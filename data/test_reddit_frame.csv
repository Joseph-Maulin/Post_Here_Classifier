**What's On Today**

The Scottish Pink Floyd Live at The Ferry



**Today in Scottish History**

Today in 1766 saw the birth of Charles Macintosh, the inventor of waterproof clothing, in Glasgow.
He created the first rainproof cloth in 1818 by joining two sheets of fabric together with dissolved rubber. Although Macintosh is best known for the coat, for the naming of which a ""k"" was added, he also made significant advances in many fields of chemistry. As well as inventing a revolutionary bleaching powder with Charles Tennant, he discovered a fast method of using carbon gases to convert iron to steel, and devised a hot-blast process which produced high quality cast iron.

On this day in 1809 William Ewart Gladstone, the British Prime Minister, was born. Though born in Liverpool, both his parents were Scottish and he always considered himself a Scot. He served a record 61 years in the House of Commons, becoming Prime Minister on no less than four occasions, the last at the age of 82. He was a gifted speaker, and in a famous election campaign in Midlothian in 1879 an estimated 20,000 people heard Gladstone speak.

My questions are:
1. Could I afford it?
2. Is it a stupid financial decision just because I want one? 

I’m in my early 20’s. I graduate with a degree in computer science in April and have a job lined up that has a $70,000 salary as a software engineer at an electric truck and van company (which means free charging at work if I do get a Tesla). I have wanted to buy a Tesla since I was 16. I wanted a P100D but can’t justify the price over a Model 3 performance. 

I’m single. I have paid off all of my student loans and have zero other debt. My rent and utilities are less than $350 a month. The only other bills I have are my food, phone, and car insurance. 

So my question is could I afford to put say $20,000 down and make payments on the rest? I have around an 800 credit score so I should be able to get a loan. I also could sell my current car for around $8,000 but I kind of want to keep it and list it on Turo or something for when I’m not using it. 

I’m young and I want to enjoy my life while I’m young. I recently got to test drive a model 3 and the second I put the acceleration pedal down my face lit up and I laughed and smiled. Driving that thing made me incredibly happy. Autopilot blew my mind. 

So guys, do I put myself in some debt and make myself happy? Or should I be more financially responsible and start investing my money and saving for retirement instead?

Before that, some Orbits found a page linking to a shop, https://orbitjapan.theshop.jp/. Prior to the MV, the shop was said to be under-construction, but as soon as the teaser dropped, so did the products.

Currently, there are two products listed on the shop, both of which are **memberships to the fanclub**:

1. ”Orbit Japan” **Japanese** Residence for ¥ 6,600 (**$64.02**)

2. ”Orbit Japan” **Non-Japanese** Residence for ¥ 2,500 (**$24.25**)


Now, there aren't any on-site translations for the Japanese Residence membership, but there is for the Non-Japanese Residence:

So apparently we are getting a greeting card for purchasing the membership. As for the members-only site itself, it's **planned** to be released **two** years from now, May 24, 2022. 

One thing I want to raise question on is the very last point:

> Expiration date of sales of members-only products 2020.5.24-2021.5.31(JST)

The way this is worded to me **at first** meant as if they are going to be putting up merchandise on their site for members-only. Essentially, we're paying to buy more merch, perhaps exclusive merch. That being said, upon a second look, the date does match the expiration date of the actual fanclub membership; so, maybe it's just re-stating the expiration of the membership and shouldn't be looked into as much.",1583840067,3gopw,LOONA,loona orbit japan   fan club non jp too ,"loona released their teaser for their japan fanclubhttpswww youtube comwatch v_e2ackxsmku a few minutes ago  before that some orbits found a page linking to a shop httpsorbitjapan theshop jp  prior to the mv the shop was said to be under construction but as soon as the teaser dropped so did the products

the way this is worded to me at first meant as if they are going to be putting up merchandise on their site for members only  essentially were paying to buy more merch perhaps exclusive merch  that being said upon a second look the date does match the expiration date of the actual fanclub membership so maybe its just re stating the expiration of the membership and shouldnt be looked into as much ","[1381, 1382, 504, 1, 1, 680, 1984, 309, 1985, 135, 1, 1381, 1181, 61, 2498, 10, 61, 504, 5248, 408, 1383, 5249, 4, 150, 206, 255, 1, 100, 12, 62, 5250, 170, 4, 1384, 5251, 3, 4, 1182, 5252, 5253, 1985, 1, 2499, 3, 2, 1607, 2, 1182, 23, 159, 3, 21, 354, 5254, 19, 24, 409, 24, 2, 2498, 5255, 25, 147, 2, 623, 128, 1, 1, 5256, 47, 22, 138, 623, 681, 14, 2, 1182, 205, 7, 78, 22, 5257, 3, 2, 5258, 1, 1382, 504, 913, 1385, 10, 1, 5259, 2500, 5260, 1, 1382, 504, 309, 913, 1385, 10, 1, 3381, 749, 5261, 47, 750, 50, 14, 475, 5262, 10, 2, 913, 1385, 1183, 19, 47, 9, 10, 2, 309, 913, 5263, 1381, 1386, 3382, 1382, 504, 309, 913, 3383, 1, 69, 1381, 1386, 680, 1984, 3384, 5264, 14, 269, 3385, 5265, 3, 12, 2, 1386, 2501, 7, 2, 1386, 680, 1984, 46, 1986, 338, 269, 5266, 69, 69, 18, 31, 114, 1387, 5267, 55, 1987, 128, 44, 22, 117, 10, 538, 80, 31, 342, 1381, 388, 1, 117, 624, 3, 1183, 128, 1382, 504, 914, 2501, 309, 913, 3383, 69, 1, 17, 9, 10, 2502, 1388, 86, 69, 69, 5268, 1183, 2503, 3381, 5269, 69, 1, 26, 18, 1988, 24, 4, 371, 55, 682, 3386, 2, 1608, 389, 7, 2, 371, 9, 269, 749, 473, 269, 1989, 5270, 128, 3386, 5271, 69, 1, 504, 298, 5272, 2504, 5273, 69, 1, 568, 3, 538, 86, 475, 1389, 32, 269, 749, 5274, 69, 3387, 1, 2505, 1, 1390, 3388, 210, 1, 1, 1, 69, 69, 3389, 8, 538, 86, 1990, 8, 504, 69, 69, 1, 1, 1, 256, 915, 12, 914, 5275, 539, 24, 409, 24, 34, 22, 245, 69, 69, 1, 1, 1, 916, 5276, 9, 425, 14, 269, 3385, 69, 69, 1, 1, 1, 44, 46, 683, 3390, 829, 3, 152, 80, 16, 1027, 148, 684, 917, 1, 128, 1608, 389, 7, 1391, 7, 538, 86, 623, 473, 146, 749, 3391, 146, 5277, 1, 1, 499, 1184, 44, 22, 201, 4, 3390, 280, 10, 1991, 2, 1183, 1, 24, 10, 2, 538, 86, 475, 569, 43, 1389, 3, 21, 1181, 138, 136, 32, 60, 269, 749, 5278, 1, 2506, 166, 5, 70, 3, 3392, 220, 14, 9, 2, 125, 143, 5279, 1608, 389, 7, 1391, 7, 538, 86, 623, 473, 146, 749, 3391, 146, 5280, 97, 17, 9, 5281, 3, 33, 28, 101, 1392, 24, 26, 34, 22, 141, 3, 21, 918, 38, 5282, 14, 61, 475, 10, 538, 86, 1, 1168, 99, 919, 3, 287, 66, 1992, 1185, 2507, 1992, 1, 12, 129, 159, 685, 4, 390, 178, 2, 389, 115, 830, 2, 1608, 389, 7, 2, 920, 3382, 1183, 25, 244, 43, 35, 1186, 5283, 2, 1608, 7, 2, 1183, 6, 1393, 21, 686, 71, 24, 113, 1]",648

We printed 6 models, but on the 7th one after completing the base the screen goes dark and the printer turns off. After resseting, the screen is dark but the fans are still working, so it must have been an overheat or screen connection problem. I open the bastard up like a clam and try to reconnect the ""ESL 1"" and ""ESL 2"" cables that go into the screen, That fixes the screen problem momentarily.

Well yeah, obviously the name Bos*MER*  already answers the question positively, but I was reading some lore  and found that upon leaving Aldmeris, they could shape-shift to adapt to  the new and hostile environment; apparently their bodies consisted of a  substance called Ooze that gave them this ability. Then the Green Pact  with Y'ffre happened, and most of them took their permanent - Bosmer -  shape, whereas those that refused were either killed in the civil war  that followed, or were branded heathens and forced to sleep in the Ooze  (of which there are apparently entire lakes in Valenwood) until the day  they accept the Green Pact, if at all.

This  happened in the Merethic Era, I think. Additionally, unlike other Mer  races, these guys can actually interbreed with Khajiit as well as other  Mer and Men. Why I'm asking this is because I haven't found and  information on other Mer races having shapeshifting abilities or an Ooze  origin.

Could it be that Bosmer  weren't originally elves, but a whole different proto-race that instead  took up a Merethic identity? Could they have been fairies originally?  That would explain their attunement to animals, nature and its spirits.",1582830000,2t5ay,teslore,are bosmer really elves ,"

Fear is a healthy response to danger, but unfortunately a lot of us are struggling with the overwhelming nature of the Coronavirus pandemic.  


My approach is very simple, broken into 'how', 'why it works' and 'variations'. They are written with the beginner in mind and as such are simplistic in their instructions and explanation. They are all variations of mindfulness practice, working on the concept that thoughts (all mental phenomena really) can be observed from a detached perspective.

286,3022430,bfa1rq,Ground connection problem?,"Hi,

&#x200B;

I've had a NUC6i3SYH for a couple of years now. I've been using it regularly as a desktop computer, never noticed anything special about it. Then recently I acquired an HDMI CEC to USB converter (for those unaware, it allows your computer to receive your TV remote input through USB) because I wanted to plug it on my 4k TV. Plugging the small device inside the NUC was very easy, since there is a CEC port (on the CPU side) and two inner USB ports.

&#x200B;

But since I put back my NUC together, every time it is plugged on mains, even with power off, I take small electric shocks from the casing. I opened the NUC again, unplugged the converter from everything, but it keeps happening. So now I wonder whether it was always like that, but I noticed just today because I'm fiddling with the cables, or whether I'm putting things back wrong somehow, and there's something touching something else that shouldn't (or maybe even another unrelated problem, like the AC/DC converter being faulty?).

Due to our requirements we run our own infrastructure and are completely separate to the main IT department, the network is highly secure and air gapped. I originally trained as a practitioner in the unit's field (it is a technical unit) however adopted the network a few years ago as I have experience running such systems.

We have around 30 users in the department but the wider user base (intermittent users when their work requires reviewing material on our network) is around 100 in total, up to 25-30 at any given point. When they want to review its a matter of patching in their desk and physically installing a desktop at their desk. When they're done I go get it and disconnect the patch. 

As the title suggests I'm trying to figure out if it's normal for 1 person to manage this or if there's usually more than 1.

We have 5 file servers 4 of which are semi highly available by using DFS-R and DFS-N, in total we have around 700Tb presented to the end users, around 400 disks across all the file servers 

We have a commvault instance which occupies another 5 servers + a 12 drive tape library, around 70 tapes a week need cycling for off-site storage.

There are around 15 Compute nodes which don't take a great deal of looking after (most of the time!) as they just provide 'grunt' via agents installed on them.

A 2 node hyperconverged hyper-v cluster with around 20 VMs which are a mix of Linux and Windows, these run a variety of production workloads. 

There are another 8 system specific servers. 

We have a couple of windows domain controllers with all the associated services! 

A number of MDT images for different hardware builds /roles which need updating periodically. These are made available via WDS. 

We have 2 relatively high performance SQL servers and 4 other instances running across the VMs. 

'I' have 4 servers which have been retired from production and I've demoted to a dev system! 

I do all the support for all the devices on the network which ranges from password resets to troubleshooting DNS and DHCP issues

I do all and any development work, ranging from abit of scripting to hardware maintaince and upgrade planning and implementation.

We don't use contractors or outsource for anything other than putting in structured cabling. 

I have done my MCSA and have got an MCSE.

Here is why you were such a shitty student in school,Carolla.

You and Drew scoff at the impeachment proceedings, involving a President who uses his power to pressure a foreign nation into giving him dirt on his biggest political rival Joe Biden.

That’s cool with you and Dr. Dickhead?

Fine, you don’t like the sanctity of American elections as long as you two have this bloated gas bag in the White House, a guy who YOU ADAM CAROLLA USED TO MOCK ON THE RADIO BACK IN THE DAY.

Now’s different for some reason. Maybe because you’ve been on Celebrity Apprentice, you find the Donald more legitimate.

He’s as crooked as they come. Abusing his power to win an election anyway he can, by withholding military aid to Ukraine until they play ball.

Of course you and Drew don’t talk about specifics. It doesn’t suit your fucking narrative, that its the libtards who are the only problem with the world.

|Fuck You Carolla, and that demented pussy Ray Oldhaufer. Zip yer cunt, bitch.

If Obama had done these things, you’d be calling for his removal, don’t think we all don’t know that.

You aren’t a smart man.

It’s the GOP who get to rig elections , huh fucktard? Because that’s what Trump did in 2016 and is doing for 2020.

And Aceman, you say the left has called every little thing he does a 10. And thats why you don’t listen to it anymore, even if it might be legitimate.

By that reason rape allegations should be ignored because of false accusations against Al Franken.

Trump wins again. Now he’s free to commit whatever fucking crimes he wants to, because you Acehat have decided everything the left calls out is false.

Bunch of fucking morons, on the right.  

Trump loves your gullibility. He did both big bad things, and a bunch of little shitty things, and you decided to focus on the little things and now call the big things nothing burgers.

The gnome.org site seems to be primarily focused towards its internal API or using GTK for application development which is not what I'm looking for per se. 

I'm primarily looking to come away with a better understanding of how the whole stack functions (low level), and possibly customize/ fix some major annoying bugs with the base desktop shell which is not exactly.. well, documented.

To give you an idea of the kind of questions I'd like answered.

An overview of the different components, their dependencies, and their standard initialization/startup process.

Details about how dbus system/user session daemons are started, their requirements, and how its different now that wayland is in the picture and its not started with /etc/X11/xsession.d?

How the default shell gnome works, after poking around it looks like its interpreted with gjs but as for gjs internals, or how gjs interacts with gdm/gnome-shell I've found ~~very little~~ nothing.

I'd like to know where I can find information about the default shell desktop (how its layed out, its behaviors, rendering pipeline, what knobs I can turn to change things) obviously a lot can be done with extensions but how do you sandbox extensions properly in wayland so you don't spend a few minutes having to reboot after gnome-shell/wayland crashes during debugging.

How does input handling work (lots of talk news about libinput, no gnome related documentation that I could find).

I can get a list of process trees but there's is almost nothing explaining or even documenting any of the child processes listed in a standard distro installation other than vague references.

The main problem with extensions is they have to be constantly updated and tested with each new gnome release, and speaking of testing how do I even ensure automated unit tests complete for extensions or gnome features if a crash brings the whole system down (i.e. child processes spawned by gnome-shell crash, and I wouldn't even know about how to go about running selenium type tests from a regular tty).

Sorry if it sounds like i'm going off on a rant, its hard to convey just how frustrating it is when you can't find almost any piece of relevant information for what is supposed to be one of the most used DEs out there.

My place of employment doesn't specify any specific OS cert since we are a huge enterprise and have most every kind of system you could imagine. MCSA is a monster of 3 exams and expensive. VMware requires a week long class and is even more expensive. I'm already very familiar with Windows and VMware anyway so I thought I'd dip into Linux. I've done the most basic of Linux admin on ESX and ESXi servers but that mostly amounted to just backups and updates. So beyond some very basic things I'm largely unfamiliar with Linux.  


All that being said. I have 6 months to certify something and professionally it's honestly just a check in the box. I most likely won't actually be working with Linux in the near future, I'd just like to broaden my knowledge a little and do it quickly.

665,260850,fj9e66,A message from Wuhan,"Hello everyone, I am a Wuhanese living in Vaud, Switzerland. It happens that my uncle's family works in the Huanan seafood market. 
Maybe in Switzerland, I'm the closest person to this coronavirus. I want to say a few words from my perspective to you, Switzerland. 

My cousin lives in the community behind the seafood market, and her mental health has collapsed, because she sees people wearing white clothes coming in and out of the community, transporting corpses every day. 
Unfortunately, one of her relative’s was infected, and the hospital took them all in, but no one dared to take care of their children. Everything was so sudden.
The first person who died of the coronavirus was a regular visitor to my uncle’s friend's booth. . . At first I didn’t ask anything about it, because I couldn’t bear it, I couldn’t bear the fear that my family would live in, I couldn’t bear my city to be famous in this way, I can't bear it all anymore.
Unfortunately I can't do anything from here to help them. However, things have improved. Medical staff from other provinces have come to help us. Wuhan has closed the city. We must know that Wuhan has just completed the military games, and its popularity and economy are on the rise.

I don't know whether my government is doing a good job or not, they have tried their best to treat everyone infected with the virus. After all, we have a population of 11 million, and Switzerland has only 8 million. All Wuhan people stayed at home obediently, because we know that our parents or grandparents will be very likely to die because of this virus, we know that we cannot let the virus further spread to other innocent people, because we know that the virus will make China's economy go backwards.

Rather than the government forcing us to stay at home, we stayed home because we don't want to be the one who is irresponsible towards society and humanity by spreading the virus. Look at the reactions of the people here.

The government closed schools and basically everything. And here you take your children to the park to play with other children, old people keep going to parks, trains are crowded etc. Here I see no masks on the road, because you think masks are useless.

You keep saying that this virus doesn't matter, that the number of deaths from the flu each year is much higher.

I want to ask you, which country have you seen closing everything because of the flu? Friday during the conference of the Canton of Vaud, they said they only have between 50 to 80 beds in Vaud for the critically ill patients, they will not test people if not above the age of 65 and in critical condition. No more quarantine for people with exposure to ill patients. The transmission rate in Switzerland is already the second highest in the world and Switzerland is the second country with the highest number of people infected per million inhabitants.

Rather than making me and my family at risk of death here in Switzerland. Please stay home. The price is so little, simply to stay at home. Don’t go party Friday night, don’t go hangout in cafés during the day with your friends.

I am even more anxious about Switzerland than swiss people. But you are putting at risk your father, mother, grandparents, and the city and country that has raised you.

If you don’t protect them, who else will protect them?

The death figures that you think are far away from you are coming here. This is just the beginning.

My mom and dad sent me 10,000 masks and asked me to share them with my friends and neighbors. My parents are ordinary residents in a less developed city, and you are a country with a per capita gdp of $83,000. Even pharmacies and hospitals here didn’t prepare enough masks. How pathetic is that?

Please help me help this country, your country. This virus is already near you, it is not too late to protect yourself, your family and your country !!!!! Thank you for your patience and for reading this, I hope and wish you not to be infected with this virus, Also hope your families stay healthy.",1584309620,2qhp6,Switzerland,a message from wuhan,"hello everyone i am a wuhanese living in vaud switzerland  it happens that my uncles family works in the huanan seafood market

928,1585721,f8sio4,Gear teeth binding on flight sim yoke.," 

NAE (Not An Engineer)

I have a yoke (Saitek Pro Flight) that I use for flight simulators. It is known for poor mechanical design so this problem (among others) is not uncommon.

The problem: When moving the yoke in or out, there is a slight increase in the amount of friction at about the midpoint. This makes things like landing more than a little frustrating.

They use a pair of plastic inline gears to transfer motion from the yoke to a potentiometer. It appears as though when the yoke is in the middle of it's stroke path, the gear teeth bottom out with the most pressure. There is no space at the bottom of the ""V"".

My question is: if I shave just a little off the bottom of each ""V"" notch in the gears in order to relieve the ""bottoming out"" pressure, will it have an adverse effect elsewhere?

The reason I am being cautious is because there is no place to get replacement parts and it would cost about $150 to replace the yoke if I damage it.

I greatly appreciate any insight.",1582556860,2sebk,AskEngineers,gear teeth binding on flight sim yoke ,"

525,2621526,f6ng8r,What the Heck,"Hey guys,

So I’m on day 100 on my stalker run and I’ve finally journeyed into Forlorn Muskeg. Well, I tried to. Immediately after transitioning from Mystery Lake I followed the railroad for a few minutes then turned left through the woods. I was trying to get to the Spence homestead.  I pass bye two wolves silently (admittedly they were glitched in place - but you never know) and continued. Another wolf. I only have 5 bullets in my rifle but I used one to take care of that wold. Phew. Well 1-2 minutes later another wolf comes sniffing from at least 300 yards away. I do have some bear meat on me but no stench bars are showing. I fight this wolf off but am wounded so I bandage up.  Moments later he (or another wolf who knows) comes back for round two. I continue south for another few feet planning on just walking away from this wolf.  Turns out directly where I’m heading there’s 5(!) more wolves. I can’t go around them because of the thin ice. I couldn’t sneak around with the other wolf trailing me. So I fight the wolf again, I’m almost dead at the point, and run back to Trapper’s.  The whole times it’s snowing and fog is getting worse. 

Is this always how Forlorn Muskeg is? 9 wolves on only the East/southeast side of the map?? Should I just never go back?

436,3250094,f82fme,Different rules for different departments at Target,"In highschool in the mid-late nineties I worked at Target. At the time (and possibly still today, I don't actually know) Target divided their departments into Hardlines and Softlines. Softlines is basically all the clothes and apparel type departments and Hardlines was everything else. Hardlines was further divided into A and B, with one being the home goods type stuff like chintzy decorative shit, soaps and cleaning supplies and the other basically toys, hardware, and electronics.
 
Target pushed the ""team"" culture to an obsessive degree and the store managers were zealots except for when it came time to close... Often the store was trashed and the closing staff had to keep working well past closing to get the store into a proper state, with Hardlines often hurting the most, and toys absolutely the worst. Basically everyone had to stay and fix the shelves till it was done, your department or not.
 
But this rule didn't apply to the Softlines or the cashiers. They left whenever they were done, usually around 1030pm. Hardlines was often there till 1am during holidays but there was occasionally a clothing sale and Softlines was equally a mess. Hardlines was always required to help Softlines because that's the team method. Softlines managers on the other hand would refuse to assist Hardlines ever despite the team rules.
 
I was in Hardlines and suffering in school because of the late nights and told my managers I needed to be leaving when my shift ended, without exception. They refused because this wasn't teamwork speak and told me that if I wanted to keep my job that I would go home when my department goes home.
 
So I transferred and started taking Softlines shifts instead. Ten pm rolls around one big sale day for hardware and Softlines is done and packing up by 1015. I go up to clock out and an told that the store leader (who is also the Hardlines manager) is calling on the radio for me to go help sort the shelves.
 
I responded that my department is done and that he told me that I leave when my department is done, went home and went to sleep.
 
I still failed two morning classes though because the damage had been done.

819,1413318,f97kx4,Sending v10 In 2020 (Baseline v6) - Tips? What else should I focus on?,"Hey all,

27 year old male here, in great health, 6'2"" / 170lbs. 11% body fat for context, vegetarian (if that factors in here).

I've been climbing for a little over 2.5yrs now, and can pretty consistently send up to v6 at my local gym usually same day as first attempt. Project grade in our gym is some v7's (depending on style) and v8 primarily. For additional context, I can typically climb v5 benchmark problems on the moonboard with few attempts, but many v6 benchmarks are near my limit.

I've been around this level of progression for the last 8 months or so - definitely plateau'd. I haven't done extensive training outside of just regular climbing and maybe 30 minutes of unstructured excercise after my 2 to 3 hour climb sessions, about 3 days a week.

In January, I started to really refocus on training and progression. This is currently structured as followed. This routine was pretty excruciating and at my limit when I started - often times not completing reps / sets because of the intensity early on. 2 months in of sticking to it, all exercises I can complete in a session, and have been seeing noticeable improvements. 

My climbing has improved noticeably on grades in the v0-v6 range, everything feels *significantly* easier already. My 2 ""rest days"" at the end of these training sessions I'm really focused on active rest, and haven't tried to benchmark my current max grade since I started this back in January. My plan is to take an adequate number of rest days at the end of this month and try and send some some new v7+ moonboard benchmarks to measure progress and see where I land.

Below is my routine. The whole point of me posting this is to ask the question to those of you that climb in the double digits, or know what it takes to climb at those grades - is this not enough to hit that v10 benchmark goal by the end of the year? If it seems I need to supplement certain focuses, where should I supplement? What else do I need to consider?

Also - one last thing. Nutrition wise, I do not eat meat. I typically eat A LOT of beans/rice/veg, focus on cooking from basic ingredients / fruit / veg instead of pre-packaged food. Caloric intake is at least 2,400 cals/day. Protein is supplemented frequently with pea-protein supplement.

606,3004441,cxheko,Hooked on Gnomes,"A while back I challenged myself to come up with 100 adventure hooks regarding gnomes. I originally posted these on my blog as a series but wanted to share them here as a single master list. I made an effort to dive through all published lore back to 1e when writing these so most go beyond your general silliness or over-the-top gnome shenanigans. Many can be used for non-gnome hooks with a few changes in wording.

01. The doors into a gnome burrow are wide open. Orange and green smoke pours from the entrance and escapes through dozens of concealed vents scattered across the landscape. A deep, rhythmic growl rattles the ground and nearly drowns out the high pitched screech of an alarm and cries for help from within.

02. A traveling gnome artificer is selling magical goods from the back of a wagon alongside the road. The vehicle is a six-wheeled behemoth upon which is built a teetering monstrosity of a house that defies both common sense and gravity.

03. A weathered gnome is cleaning gore off of a collection of weapons while a well-groomed attendant dresses the gnome's wounds. Nearby are two fresh graves and a heap of bloody goblin heads.

04. An ancient gnome in well-worn adventure gear carries on a one-sided conversation with a cluster of boulders. For a price, he or she will ask the rocks a question about themselves or their surroundings on the party's behalf and relay the answer.

**Dear Cardano Community,**

we are **Standardize Network**, a Cardano stake pool in the Incentiviced testnet. In this article we want to give you a short introduction on our project scope and who we are.

Short disclamer: The Cardano project is still at an early stage and we just want to share our vision and perspective. There is much to be changed and it's impossible to come up with a fixed plan or even calculations at this point. Please keep that in mind, while reading this project outline!

Our primary goals are on the one hand, to keep up our high availability node cluster, to help securing the Cardano network and make computational power available to the smart contract layer in the future. Therefor we run our pool on dedicated hardware, in a very good datacenter in Finland, with a fallback system in Germany. And on the other hand, we want to support critical open source software, to help other people and us to get more independent of big software companies, such as Google, Microsoft or Facebook, just to mention a few, because we believe, financial freedom is not enough, when your device is not under your full control. I will explain our approach in more detail further down.

A few words on our team. We are three people, two developers/admins hosting and developing webplatforms and apps and a governance researcher in blockchain topics. For the last five months we were able to get to know Jormungandr, the current Rust implementation of the Cardano protocol and experiment in different testnets and scenarios. Although it's not stable at all, we implemented a system that hardly fails, running ten nodes in parallel. The commuinity was very helpful and Andrew Westberg from **BlueCheeseStakeHouse** published the best node cluster software, we have seen so far and we are using it with great success.

We are closely following the Cardano project since 2017 and our aim is, to support open source software with the funds collected by providing the pool. Our approch will be, to create accounts filling up slowly with funds and support software development with it, when our delegators are convinced by the developers proposals and ideas.

An example and starting point will be, to use 2% of our poolfee to pay for maintainence and server cost and let 3% flow to three accounts, 1% each. We want to start with these three project ideas:

1. An Android Version without a google core, that runs well and is easy to use. There were several projects already existing, but they all could need funding and improvement.
2. A Linux Desktop Distribution, we've selected Manjaro, because it's in our opinion the best out there and supports almost all available software in the Linux ecosystem.
3. A server operating system called CentOS, because it's a very good OS to run every service, the internet of today is depending on it and its free and community developed.

Of course we know, these are very ambitious goals, but as I said, it's a first starting point. We are currently developing a platform to interact closely with our delegators and we want to set or redefine our goals with you together! The testnet will go on for quiet some time and we are very open to your feedback and ideas and will develop and find a strategy that fits the technical and economical reality in the Cardano ecosystem, as it is further developed in the next months. On our platform we want to enable a decision making process, that takes the amount of stake you hold in effect.

This is why we call ourselves ""**Standardize Network**"". We will support software that is enabling and interoperable. We are not happy with the current way it's being done in many sectors. Not the user should adapt to multiple differing platforms, for example to only write a text messages to a friend. We imagine that multiple apps are able to send messages to different services. Therefore we need to develop standards, for example for what a typical message is.

A few words about the current testnet situation: The last epochs have been quite successful for us. Although we currently have 'only' 2.2M tADA staked, we are doing one or two blocks per epoch consistently and we have paid out already over 15K tADA to our delegators. You can see our pools performance on Pooltool or [adapools.org](https://adapools.org), searching for our ticker **STDN**. Sometimes it is even more rewarding, to delegate for a smaller pool, as you can see in the following chart.

We encurrage you to visit our website [standardize.network](https://www.standardize.network) to see our ten node cluster at work. We have planned many improvements such as mapping stakepool names automatically to our ""stake distribution"" section and also to show our block schedule and earlier minted blocks there. If you have questions, you can always check in at our [Telegram](https://t.me/standardize) channel, or reply here on Reddit.

We will keep you updated how the project is evolving. Cheers and thank you, for your support!

a few words on our team  we are three people two developersadmins hosting and developing webplatforms and apps and a governance researcher in blockchain topics  for the last five months we were able to get to know jormungandr the current rust implementation of the cardano protocol and experiment in different testnets and scenarios  although its not stable at all we implemented a system that hardly fails running ten nodes in parallel  the commuinity was very helpful and andrew westberg from bluecheesestakehouse published the best node cluster software we have seen so far and we are using it with great success 

we are closely following the cardano project since 2017 and our aim is to support open source software with the funds collected by providing the pool  our approch will be to create accounts filling up slowly with funds and support software development with it when our delegators are convinced by the developers proposals and ideas 

an example and starting point will be to use 2 of our poolfee to pay for maintainence and server cost and let 3 flow to three accounts 1 each  we want to start with these three project ideas

1  an android version without a google core that runs well and is easy to use  there were several projects already existing but they all could need funding and improvement 
2  a linux desktop distribution weve selected manjaro because its in our opinion the best out there and supports almost all available software in the linux ecosystem 
3  a server operating system called centos because its a very good os to run every service the internet of today is depending on it and its free and community developed 

of course we know these are very ambitious goals but as i said its a first starting point  we are currently developing a platform to interact closely with our delegators and we want to set or redefine our goals with you together  the testnet will go on for quiet some time and we are very open to your feedback and ideas and will develop and find a strategy that fits the technical and economical reality in the cardano ecosystem as it is further developed in the next months  on our platform we want to enable a decision making process that takes the amount of stake you hold in effect 

this is why we call ourselves standardize network  we will support software that is enabling and interoperable  we are not happy with the current way its being done in many sectors  not the user should adapt to multiple differing platforms for example to only write a text messages to a friend  we imagine that multiple apps are able to send messages to different services  therefore we need to develop standards for example for what a typical message is 

a few words about the current testnet situation the last epochs have been quite successful for us  although we currently have only 2 2m tada staked we are doing one or two blocks per epoch consistently and we have paid out already over 15k tada to our delegators  you can see our pools performance on pooltool or adapools orghttpsadapools org searching for our ticker stdn  sometimes it is even more rewarding to delegate for a smaller pool as you can see in the following chart

509,198454,fcmuo9,[threads][derived fields] Found a Pattern for precalculating derived fields. Good or Bad?,"Before I start using this pattern, I came up with, I'd like to know what you think.

It is intended to reduce the CPU load when calculating derived fields.
If for example `T1 someField` is a rotation for a camera, and `T2 derivedReadonlyLikeField` describes the point the camera is looking at, then the second field/property can be calculated from the first.
To make this calculation happen as soon as possible, without slowing the execution of an application (games), I run another execution thread.
The computed field is frequently needed, but not necessarily immediately.

Good: Dimensions seems right, leather is small caviar, chevrons are in line and correct in number. Strap appears correct with no stitching and end of leather folded into metal. Pocket is ok, I believe it has the mona lisa smile? Can't really tell. The inside logo is a tad thick but it seems par for the course with 187 minis.

Concerns in order of importance:

1. Wrinkle/flatness on the front near the bottom. The first photo seems like it's indented there and the second seems to show it's not as puffy on the last ""v""
2. The CC clasp's top left bit seems a tad too short.
3. I believe the bottom's stitches, the two inner rows are supposed to be smaller, with the 2 outer rows about 1.5x in size. 
4. The chanel paris plate on the inside: is it the shadowing or does one screw seem elevated and the other flat? There also appears to be some glue, but I feel like I should be able to remove that.
5. The inner picture might have a ripple on the right side but that could be normal?

Feel free to CCW hard as this is my first rep and I want to get it right. My biggest issue is the lack of puffiness at the front bottom. That doesn't seem normal. Is that enough to ask for a different one? I know 187 has difficult returns and I don't want to make things hard for Heidi. I'm concerned about the other things, but I feel like perhaps it's reflection distorting things (eg CC clasp).

good dimensions seems right leather is small caviar chevrons are in line and correct in number  strap appears correct with no stitching and end of leather folded into metal  pocket is ok i believe it has the mona lisa smile  cant really tell  the inside logo is a tad thick but it seems par for the course with 187 minis 

concerns in order of importance

1  wrinkleflatness on the front near the bottom  the first photo seems like its indented there and the second seems to show its not as puffy on the last v
2  the cc clasps top left bit seems a tad too short 
3  i believe the bottoms stitches the two inner rows are supposed to be smaller with the 2 outer rows about 1 5x in size  
4  the chanel paris plate on the inside is it the shadowing or does one screw seem elevated and the other flat  there also appears to be some glue but i feel like i should be able to remove that 
5  the inner picture might have a ripple on the right side but that could be normal 

feel free to ccw hard as this is my first rep and i want to get it right  my biggest issue is the lack of puffiness at the front bottom  that doesnt seem normal  is that enough to ask for a different one  i know 187 has difficult returns and i dont want to make things hard for heidi  im concerned about the other things but i feel like perhaps its reflection distorting things eg cc clasp  tia ","[2403, 4721, 1208, 557, 8, 383, 3213, 4722, 9611, 32, 4723, 2404, 9612, 9613, 9614, 1, 176, 644, 774, 4665, 4724, 1, 887, 9, 9615, 1224, 9616, 2987, 1063, 9617, 9618, 557, 1208, 9619, 383, 4722, 272, 3213, 1753, 2403, 900, 9620, 1224, 9621, 4725, 219, 133, 1753, 9, 272, 3213, 9622, 22, 8, 445, 6, 995, 8, 398, 1, 4726, 988, 995, 15, 53, 9623, 6, 160, 7, 1753, 9624, 71, 1075, 1, 4127, 9, 1435, 5, 597, 11, 57, 2, 9625, 9626, 2070, 1, 122, 104, 264, 1, 2, 447, 3417, 9, 4, 4727, 1262, 19, 11, 219, 9627, 10, 2, 348, 15, 2403, 9628, 9629, 8, 234, 7, 9630, 1, 9631, 14, 2, 611, 567, 2, 1001, 1, 2, 101, 2350, 219, 29, 43, 9632, 47, 6, 2, 390, 219, 3, 346, 43, 27, 24, 9633, 14, 2, 143, 9634, 1, 2, 2405, 9635, 254, 314, 281, 219, 4, 4727, 135, 454, 1093, 1, 5, 597, 2, 9636, 9637, 2, 138, 1531, 4728, 22, 1086, 3, 21, 591, 15, 2, 91, 2960, 4728, 45, 84, 9638, 8, 334, 1, 3013, 1, 2, 4721, 9639, 1140, 14, 2, 447, 9, 11, 2, 9640, 20, 115, 51, 1559, 605, 9641, 6, 2, 67, 9642, 1, 47, 102, 988, 3, 21, 62, 9643, 19, 5, 140, 29, 5, 111, 21, 153, 3, 1045, 12, 3014, 1, 2, 1531, 528, 230, 16, 4, 9644, 14, 2, 133, 329, 19, 12, 112, 21, 421, 9645, 185, 3, 9646, 214, 24, 17, 9, 13, 101, 3717, 6, 5, 70, 3, 48, 11, 133, 1, 13, 1483, 385, 9, 2, 4729, 7, 9647, 28, 2, 611, 1001, 1, 12, 173, 605, 421, 1, 9, 12, 246, 3, 336, 10, 4, 216, 51, 1, 5, 56, 2403, 57, 4730, 4068, 6, 5, 49, 70, 3, 103, 164, 214, 10, 4723, 1, 30, 1761, 45, 2, 67, 164, 19, 5, 140, 29, 1185, 43, 9648, 9649, 164, 4586, 2405, 9650, 1, 4542, 1]",147

722,278437,eycxac,Models holds true at every point in a relationship,"Hey so I wanted to tell of my relationship with a girl, who just broke up with me. We went out for like three months, broke up for two weeks, got back together for a couple days and broke up. Now what happens in relationships about letting the foot off the gas, even unofficial ones, and not polarizing holds true. 

What the girl told me, let's call her D, is that x and y million things led to her losing her attraction for me. I'm not her typical taste in men, she likes guys usually of rough sports, which are unabashedly masculine. Plus there's some other things she brought up that were bad in me that of course we're never brought up before, like my style. 

But the point is that what I think really happened, other than the breakup sort of making things uncomfortable, is that I stopped polarizing. Like I used to not be her type or share things that she was into, like she said. But I used to be proud about baking, or playing classical music, or my boring style. Everything. Like even if she didn't like it I'd share and show my passion about it. I'd show my passion in bed too. 

All of that started to change when I saw her as being more into me and putting in the effort. So I sort of started coasting through. There's also the fact that I'm older and in a usual office job, while she's younger and sort of wild. So she's into usually kind of punk or rock guys, guys who don't give a fuck. I'm the opposite, but the way that I express myself usually makes it not boring. Like if you take three kinds of guys. One, the rule follower and setter, the hardliner that's passionate about why the rules are there and actually fights to set law. Then there's the rule breaker. Then there's the one that sort of coasts along, average Joe. I was the first (unlike when I was younger where I was rule breaker) but by straying from my true self, I got to a sort of boring point where I didn't target any girl.

I had some feminine things, some masculine things, some x, y and z. All apparently contradictory. Hell even my style, not formal formal, not alternative, not x or y. Just some mix. 

Anyway the point is to never forget to always strive to maximize your own tastes and personality. You don't have to be that stereotype of a bodybuilder, or rock star, or artist. But maximize your passion within each attribute so you can polarize women. Make them drool to fuck you or shoot you. I'm excited. I'm a little blindsided, didn't expect her to flip so quickly. But I'm excited that I can use this opportunity to go back to only giving a fuck about what I think is important, not caring about the mundane, and polarizing women with no fear.",1580760223,2qhrv,seduction,models holds true at every point in a relationship,"hey so i wanted to tell of my relationship with a girl who just broke up with me  we went out for like three months broke up for two weeks got back together for a couple days and broke up  now what happens in relationships about letting the foot off the gas even unofficial ones and not polarizing holds true

**The Story so far...**  
Our two heroes are Reclaimers - adventurers in the employ of Morrowind's grand council to seek and reclaim lost treasures and history of the dunmer people.
They've delved to the very depths of the lost Red Mountain Citadel; Dagoth Ur and found a strange, unrecognizable gemstone, which, when touched emitted simply the phrase: ""A.S.""

------------------------------------------------------------  

>...And from it came a voice; a velvety firmness of a voice. It said simply - the most revoltingly unsatisfactory thing I ever heard - it whispered: ""A.S.""  
>And then its glow faded back into the depths....

**Part Five**

We both stood dumbstruck for several long seconds that stretched on like years, straining our ears in the silence as though listening for the echo of what the crystal had said. 'A.S.'  
Belas was the first of us to shake off the stupor: ""Any idea what that could mean? A.S.?""  
My mind raced through a million possibilities, all seeming equally likely or unlikely. I was simply, bluntly clueless.  
""I haven't the slightest idea,"" I admitted.  
And then another heavy silence fell upon us, as we both silently contemplated the strangeness of this peculiar gem. But then something shook us both from our reverie, as the incessant whispering returned. Neither of us had noticed how it had faded to nothing - we'd been so focused on the gem - but now they returned, and seemed even louder than before. They filled my head like the buzzing of fetcherflies; incomprehensible, but unmistakably malicious. Belas called to me, his voice louder than it ought to have been, as though he was trying to drown out the whispers, or his own fear perhaps: ""Let's get out of this cursed place!""  
I agreed in a heartbeat, and we both made for the exit. It was only some strange demand of dignity, that kept us from breaking into a headlong run. And as we marched to the exit, the most childishly terrifying idea filled me, that if I were to look back I would see a shambling grotesque, a corprus monster reaching out after me with its fleshly deformities. My neck ached as I forced myself not to look back. When we emerged into the dwemer hallways, which now seemed so civilized and immaculate in comparison, the whispers were already fading, and soon we slowed down, our fear subsiding. We both stopped to catch our breath. Though we hadn't even been running, we were both sweating heavily beneath our chitin.  
""If the Council ever sends me to Vvardenfell again, I'll plainly refuse. Throw me in the dungeons 'neath Narsis if they please. I ain't going near anything 'Sixth House' again.""  
I finally allowed myself a look back. Nothing but darkness behind us; an empty hallway. I breathed deeply, and turned away from those grim shadows, and set for the exit, Belas eagerly following behind me.  
Though we were both tired to the bone, neither of us dared spend the night within those ancient halls, ash storm or no. And so we made our way back through the darkened hallways up to the surface, having silently agreed that we had explored all we wished to explore of Dagoth Ur's citadel. The trip back to the surface seemed much faster than the journey down (probably because we were no longer worn down by reluctance) and we soon found ourselves back at the entrance, where the brass gate was still closed shut, impervious to the rage of the storm without. We braced ourselves, and pushed open the door to meet the howling wind. Outside, the ashstorm was churning as violently as ever and we forced our way through it, arms held up before our eyes as the wind lashed at our chitin. We made our way to the top of the crater, and then we tripped and slipped our way through the loose layer of pebbles and ash that covered the side of the volcano, eventually reaching level ground. The heat had long since dissipated, but still the murmurous rumble and the ash-darkened sky followed us as we walked on in the shadow of the Red Mountain.  
We continued on in silence for a while, stubbornly refusing to give in to fatigue before we had put as much distance as possible between ourselves and those terrible, barren halls.   
Finally though, after what felt like hours of plodding through the ash storm, we finally settled down, and pitched our tent for the night and curled up underneath the rattling tarpaulin, and we both fell into a troubled sleep.  

When we woke the next morning, the storm had finally let up, and we forced open the tent cover and unearthed ourselves from the ash cover which had settled through the night.  
We ate a meagre breakfast - one last ration of pickled marshmerrow that Belas had hidden for such a time, for nothing lived there in those ash wastes - and packed up our tent in solemn silence, nerves still shaken. However, we hadn't walked for long, before Belas took up conversation again, apparelently unable keep silent.  
""That thing we found in Dagoth Ur... I haven't a clue what it is, but I'm sure the Council will be interested"" - he hesitated - ""Probably interested enough that they won't mind us not doing the full sweep of every citadel.""  
""That fear or laziness talking?"" I taunted.
""Both.""   
""Fair enough,"" I smiled for the first time in several days. ""We'll swing by the coast, around Vivec, check out the old daedric shrine sites. If we can pick up some relic or other belonging to the Reclations, the Council'll be ecstatic. They might even send a proper expedition up here next.""  
""'Long as they don't include me in it,"" Belas said, as he spat a glob of ash aside. ""I believe I've had enough of this business. I'm thinking of retiring.""  
""Retiring? You?"" I asked indredulously. ""A scout that hangs it up? What do you plan on doing?""  
""I'll figure something out,"" he shrugged. ""But this;"" he waved a hand about as if to say exploration in general - ""ruins, ash storms and demons, going hungry every other night... That's all well and good for adventurous types like you, but me... I was born in Narsis, and I bloody well plan on dying there.""
""In your own bed?"" I suggested, teasing.  
""Aye,"" he answered, unabashed. ""And I'll return to the ash with my ancestors. I don't plan on being cut down by bandits, or ending up like kagouti dung in the middle of nowhere. I reckon this'll be my last reclamation.""  
""Fair,"" I said, though this made me a little melancholy. Though I could see the sense in it; settling down, falling asleep in my own bed every night... I knew that would truly be the death of me, for there was only so much you could do, managing a house and the daily toil for food. It seemed to me the world was meant to be explored, and I planned on doing it till it killed me.  

The next few days we steadily picked up pace and mood. We followed a foyada south, towards the coast, travelling swiftly with a soft wind at our backs. The ash storms had died down, almost as if land was now content to let off, seeing us leave. It was three nights before we took the first step into the soft, muddy grass of the Ascadian isles (now thick with forest, for there were no one left to chop it down for agriculture). Animal life began to flourish around us. We picked fresh marshmerrow by the bushel, and Belas even managed to take down a wayward netch calf, and we feasted till our stomachs were like to burst - and still we didn't eat half the thing, so we left the rest to the Nix Hounds, and set up camp a good distance away from the smelly carcass.  
Every day Belas became more talkative, thinking aloud of all the things he might give himself to doing once we had returned to Narsis. Carpenter, mason, smith... in general, just variations on theme of staying in Narsis and building things. One afternoon, however, his daydreaming was cut short, for we happened upon the ruins of a daedric shrine.  
The early chimer architecture was so otherwordly and wierd that, although I had seen it many times before and it had begun to win back popularity among the Temple of Reclamations, I was still as astounded by it now as I had been the first time I laid eyes on such a shrine. Twisted spires and impossible archways, portals that led into backwards hallways and blind corners. Of course, much of it was reduced to rubble now. It was clear that the last eruption of Red Mountain had laid a terrible siege to this place. Whether by raining debris, quakes, or both, I couldn't tell, but many of the spires had fallen and somewhere small ravines had opened where the roof had collapsed into the shrine below.  
We surveyed the ruins from a small hillock. The shrine was situated on the very edge of the water, before the Ascadian isle gave way to a myraid broken islets that finally thinned out towards the sea. One of the spires had fallen over and been swallowed by the water, but nevertheless I could still see the shrine's main doorway, unbroken by the ravages of time and seismic upheaval.  
""So which one do you think this is?"" I asked Belas. 
He squinted at the ruins for some time, as though expecting to find the name written across the stone. Of course, I knew he was really dreaming up a mental map of Vvardenfell, and correlating it with out last few days of travel.  
""Well, we passed lake Masobi yesterday, and I'm fairly certain we've been heading steadily south. We're certainly not at Bal Fell, for we know that one's completely sunken into the sea."" He chewed his lip for a moment. ""Haven't a clue.""  
""Right, let's have a look then,"" I said cheerily, for somehow a broken old daedric shrine seemed harmless, when I thought back to the howling winds and the dark halls of the Sixth House that we faced atop Red Mountain.

i agreed in a heartbeat and we both made for the exit  it was only some strange demand of dignity that kept us from breaking into a headlong run  and as we marched to the exit the most childishly terrifying idea filled me that if i were to look back i would see a shambling grotesque a corprus monster reaching out after me with its fleshly deformities  my neck ached as i forced myself not to look back  when we emerged into the dwemer hallways which now seemed so civilized and immaculate in comparison the whispers were already fading and soon we slowed down our fear subsiding  we both stopped to catch our breath  though we hadnt even been running we were both sweating heavily beneath our chitin   
if the council ever sends me to vvardenfell again ill plainly refuse  throw me in the dungeons neath narsis if they please  i aint going near anything sixth house again   
i finally allowed myself a look back  nothing but darkness behind us an empty hallway  i breathed deeply and turned away from those grim shadows and set for the exit belas eagerly following behind me   
though we were both tired to the bone neither of us dared spend the night within those ancient halls ash storm or no  and so we made our way back through the darkened hallways up to the surface having silently agreed that we had explored all we wished to explore of dagoth urs citadel  the trip back to the surface seemed much faster than the journey down probably because we were no longer worn down by reluctance and we soon found ourselves back at the entrance where the brass gate was still closed shut impervious to the rage of the storm without  we braced ourselves and pushed open the door to meet the howling wind  outside the ashstorm was churning as violently as ever and we forced our way through it arms held up before our eyes as the wind lashed at our chitin  we made our way to the top of the crater and then we tripped and slipped our way through the loose layer of pebbles and ash that covered the side of the volcano eventually reaching level ground  the heat had long since dissipated but still the murmurous rumble and the ash darkened sky followed us as we walked on in the shadow of the red mountain   
we continued on in silence for a while stubbornly refusing to give in to fatigue before we had put as much distance as possible between ourselves and those terrible barren halls    
finally though after what felt like hours of plodding through the ash storm we finally settled down and pitched our tent for the night and curled up underneath the rattling tarpaulin and we both fell into a troubled sleep   

when we woke the next morning the storm had finally let up and we forced open the tent cover and unearthed ourselves from the ash cover which had settled through the night   
we ate a meagre breakfast   one last ration of pickled marshmerrow that belas had hidden for such a time for nothing lived there in those ash wastes   and packed up our tent in solemn silence nerves still shaken  however we hadnt walked for long before belas took up conversation again apparelently unable keep silent   
that thing we found in dagoth ur    i havent a clue what it is but im sure the council will be interested   he hesitated   probably interested enough that they wont mind us not doing the full sweep of every citadel   
that fear or laziness talking  i taunted 
both    
fair enough i smiled for the first time in several days  well swing by the coast around vivec check out the old daedric shrine sites  if we can pick up some relic or other belonging to the reclations the councilll be ecstatic  they might even send a proper expedition up here next   
long as they dont include me in it belas said as he spat a glob of ash aside  i believe ive had enough of this business  im thinking of retiring   
retiring  you  i asked indredulously  a scout that hangs it up  what do you plan on doing   
ill figure something out he shrugged  but this he waved a hand about as if to say exploration in general   ruins ash storms and demons going hungry every other night    thats all well and good for adventurous types like you but me    i was born in narsis and i bloody well plan on dying there 
in your own bed  i suggested teasing   
aye he answered unabashed  and ill return to the ash with my ancestors  i dont plan on being cut down by bandits or ending up like kagouti dung in the middle of nowhere  i reckon thisll be my last reclamation   
fair i said though this made me a little melancholy  though i could see the sense in it settling down falling asleep in my own bed every night    i knew that would truly be the death of me for there was only so much you could do managing a house and the daily toil for food  it seemed to me the world was meant to be explored and i planned on doing it till it killed me   

the next few days we steadily picked up pace and mood  we followed a foyada south towards the coast travelling swiftly with a soft wind at our backs  the ash storms had died down almost as if land was now content to let off seeing us leave  it was three nights before we took the first step into the soft muddy grass of the ascadian isles now thick with forest for there were no one left to chop it down for agriculture  animal life began to flourish around us  we picked fresh marshmerrow by the bushel and belas even managed to take down a wayward netch calf and we feasted till our stomachs were like to burst   and still we didnt eat half the thing so we left the rest to the nix hounds and set up camp a good distance away from the smelly carcass   
every day belas became more talkative thinking aloud of all the things he might give himself to doing once we had returned to narsis  carpenter mason smith    in general just variations on theme of staying in narsis and building things  one afternoon however his daydreaming was cut short for we happened upon the ruins of a daedric shrine   
the early chimer architecture was so otherwordly and wierd that although i had seen it many times before and it had begun to win back popularity among the temple of reclamations i was still as astounded by it now as i had been the first time i laid eyes on such a shrine  twisted spires and impossible archways portals that led into backwards hallways and blind corners  of course much of it was reduced to rubble now  it was clear that the last eruption of red mountain had laid a terrible siege to this place  whether by raining debris quakes or both i couldnt tell but many of the spires had fallen and somewhere small ravines had opened where the roof had collapsed into the shrine below   
we surveyed the ruins from a small hillock  the shrine was situated on the very edge of the water before the ascadian isle gave way to a myraid broken islets that finally thinned out towards the sea  one of the spires had fallen over and been swallowed by the water but nevertheless i could still see the shrines main doorway unbroken by the ravages of time and seismic upheaval   
so which one do you think this is  i asked belas  
he squinted at the ruins for some time as though expecting to find the name written across the stone  of course i knew he was really dreaming up a mental map of vvardenfell and correlating it with out last few days of travel   
well we passed lake masobi yesterday and im fairly certain weve been heading steadily south  were certainly not at bal fell for we know that ones completely sunken into the sea  he chewed his lip for a moment  havent a clue   
right lets have a look then i said cheerily for somehow a broken old daedric shrine seemed harmless when i thought back to the howling winds and the dark halls of the sixth house that we faced atop red mountain

the story so far     
our two heroes are reclaimers   adventurers in the employ of morrowinds grand council to seek and reclaim lost treasures and history of the dunmer people 
theyve delved to the very depths of the lost red mountain citadel dagoth ur and found a strange unrecognizable gemstone which when touched emitted simply the phrase a s 

                                                              

   and from it came a voice a velvety firmness of a voice  it said simply   the most revoltingly unsatisfactory thing i ever heard   it whispered a s   
and then its glow faded back into the depths    

part five

we both stood dumbstruck for several long seconds that stretched on like years straining our ears in the silence as though listening for the echo of what the crystal had said  a s   
belas was the first of us to shake off the stupor any idea what that could mean  a s    
my mind raced through a million possibilities all seeming equally likely or unlikely  i was simply bluntly clueless   
i havent the slightest idea i admitted   
and then another heavy silence fell upon us as we both silently contemplated the strangeness of this peculiar gem  but then something shook us both from our reverie as the incessant whispering returned  neither of us had noticed how it had faded to nothing   wed been so focused on the gem   but now they returned and seemed even louder than before  they filled my head like the buzzing of fetcherflies incomprehensible but unmistakably malicious  belas called to me his voice louder than it ought to have been as though he was trying to drown out the whispers or his own fear perhaps lets get out of this cursed place

So I recently tried some beyerdynamics beat Byrds and I find them very comfortable but only downside is they don't isolate noise well at all. What I like about the Byrds is they don't protude out of the ear. I have heard IEMs are the best for noise isolation, but I don't really want to loop the wires around my ear, I prefer them to come straight down.

I also have a pair of jaybird x3s which are much better at noise isolating, but not as comfortable. I don't mind wired.

Any pairs anyone can suggest?

526,1712820,f1ktwd,Selling two items together rather than having to add two items to the cart,Okay so hear me out as this may seem a bit confusing. I sell two items that need to be bought together in a set. Just think of it as I sell shoes individually rather than as a pair (I don’t but best way to describe it) so I’m looking for a way for a person to be able to click “set” rather than “left” pick the size then add to cart then go back and “right” pick the size then add to cart. Right now I’m losing customers as they are confused on how to order two items. I would need the setting to be where once they click set another option comes with it asking size of “left” size of “right”. This way instead of having to go thru picking each size and left or right they can do it all at once. Sorry if it’s rather confusing but I asked shopify support and right now they can’t really find a way to do it. I know it’s a weird request so I’m wondering if anyone was able to do this.

316,2154507,fgntug,Network design for a startup,"Hi all,

I have the unique privileged of design a cloud-first network design approach for a startup. Currently, we have very few desktops that are totally remote with point-to-site VPN enabled, however in the below proposal we're trying to build out our first on-premise location.

We plan on using a shared workspace environment (in this example, WeWork) so we'd ideally like to segregate our network traffic, and route most of our internal server-based traffic through internal routing mechanisms, using a site-to-site VPN. 

We will only have one site for the time being, but I think in this picture it should accommodate for additional spokes connecting to either the single hub, or a second hub with redundant peerings.

Can you guys please have a look and let me know if you think I've missed something? I'm not a networking guy so interested to have your take on it as well!

This will be quite long, and I don't take all the credit for these ideas (Gaser, Amon, Viable\_Golem, stret, and several others had the same or similar ideas for some of these characters).

Warden  
Top heavy damage reduced from 40>35

Dodging a SB or charged SB no longer garuntees GB, but still guarantee's dodge attack

Toe stab is no longer affected by Haymaker.

Recoveries can now be canceled with Skewer or Toe stab

Skewer can be soft-feinted into Toe stab

Skewer ignore's HA

Black Prior  
I think BP is the most balanced character in the game, the only thing I would change is her zone.

Zone has larger hit box and deals 10 dmg.

Raider, Legendary  
Animations are smoother

Add stunning tap back

Zone now uses much less stamina but the dmg from a chained one is reduced to 35

Berzerker  
Top lights now 400ms

Highlander  
Offensive heavy now deals 35 dmg

Caber toss now catches rolls

Defensive lights are now 500ms.

Can do a SB after heavy (whiffed or not), but is not guaranteed in chains.

Warlord  
Top light is now 500ms

Headbutt can now chain on whiff

The Vikings Elbow

This move is accessible in chains and headbutts can directly flow into this even on whiff.

Move is normally 600ms, but can be charged up to 800ms.

You know his execution of the same name, yeah it's that.

Does 35 damage, drains like 25 stamina, and stuns on hit.

Fully punishable on dodge since it requires a read.

Crashing Charge

No longer carries the person backwards 42 miles.

Is now 400ms.

Now stuns.

Chains.

Full guard

Undodgeable now chains.

Light heavy attack, and headbutt recoveries can now be cancelled into the full guard.

New Move : Shield Smack, is a 400ms bash that can be accessed directly from the full guard, guarantees a light and is punishable on a dodge.

Block and stab damage increased to 25.

Zone

Now chains.

Can be done in chains.

400ms bash.

Shaman  
Well balanced

Hulda  
Increased forward movement on neutral bash

Bashing after a parry now guarantees a light (if the attack parried was a heavy) or heavy (vise versa)

Kensei  
Mixup can be done from any heavy

Orochi

Can do Hurricane blast instead of finisher heavy

Hurricane blast deals 30 dmg when chained.

Dodge attacks are now heavies

Shinobi  
Make kick 400ms

Is now inputted by forward GB (there's a reason for this).

New thing, double dodge GB, this has the same input as the old kick.

Double dodge now must chain into one of those options, no more plain old double dodging.

This would essentially give him a 50/50 from neutral stemming from the double dodge turning this into more of an offensive tool rather than a defensive tool.

Ranged Attacks and Backflip

Backflip no longer done after throwing an attack, is now done from neutral with backwards GB.

Backflip now chains directly into ranged attacks and is also forced to do this.

Ranged heavies are now 300ms.

Ranged heavies can no longer be charged from neutral.

Delete ranged GB.

Regular front flip and front flip kick are now two separate moves

Front flip kick is now 400ms.

3. Front flip kick now guarantees a light and no longer sends you flying.

This again gives him some offense with this as now you have to prediction dodge the kick leaving you vulnerable to a GB.

All neutral heavies damage reduced to 25 + the 10 damage followup hit.

Heavy finishers damage reduced to 25 (they still guarantee Sickle Rain).

Light openers damage reduced to 8 (still guarantees the light followup).

Kick after deflect is now 400ms, but no longer guaranteed, essentially turning half the damage into a read based thing rather than it just being guaranteed.

Increase it to 120.

Deflect dmg reduced to 35 but is now unblockable

Heavies can be charged (upto 800ms) into an unblockable heavy that deals 37 dmg

Dodge attack are now enhanced

Dodge heavies no longer count as light parries

Zone uses less stamina and is 500ms

OVERALL BALANCE  
Any attack that staggers, now grants the staggered dmg reduction from players who didn't do the stagger.

I know what I just said was total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so let me give an example instead.

Shaman pounces warden, while Nobushi(shaman's teammate) waits.

Shaman gets the full 40 dmg, but Nobushi only gets 3 dmg from hitting the warden while he was immobilized.

Thick Skin now has a cooldown of 20 seconds

Rock Steady is now an active feat with a duration of 30 seconds and a cooldown of 80.

Walls no longer block attacks

Walls no longer prevent dodge i-frames

I would like to do the same thing with CP2077, but I am a big fan of CDPR's work after spending hundreds of hours in The Witcher trilogy. I want to support them as much as I can, while collecting their physical goodies as a massive bonus that is unfortunately not possible on Stadia at the moment.

There is also the disadvantage (and blessing) of not having the option to preorder games on Stadia. I am pretty sure there are some exclusive stages/skins if you pre-order DE. How are the Stadia players supposed to choose if they want to access that content?

First off, I don't know why law enforcement thought they were doing something? Other than BP, all the other ad sites that were forced to move to Switzerland or whatever because of FOSTA are still in operation. A lot of them require providers to verify. This means that the women posting are more likely to be working for themselves. **They are independent operators trying to make a living, not sad trafficking victims.**

And guess what has picked up the slack? Because we all know men have NOT stopped buying sex.

Seeking Arrangement's Brandon Wade is currently the biggest legally operating pimp on the internet. 

Sugaring sites attract scum and johns who would have paid for escorts but now fuck naive young women for the promise of money. Many times not even actual money but the promise of it!

There are mongering / slobbyist review sites with pics of actual ""vanilla"" girls or sugar babies naming them and saying exactly what they will do for $200. These girls have no idea their private information and activities are being shared among predators. They also are likely to only do sex work for a short period, but their information will be out there forever. A college student trying to make a few bucks to pay off student loans will forever be branded for a choice she made in her 20s.

In addition to its other crimes, Seeking Arrangment in particular allows racist content on their profiles. Yes, ever seen one with the phrase ""no blacks""?

There is NO screening of members on a sugaring site.

They allow any man with a credit card to sign up, do not background check, and the majority of men do not even have a photo. This leaves vulnerable young women open to blackmail, sex trafficking, and straight up fraud. 

The popular scam is for a ""sugar daddy"" to ask a young lady for her banking info so he can perpetuate wire fraud. Others ask for women to send gift cards to ""prove"" themselves.

Why is it that a site like this is allowed to operate with ZERO scrutiny from the law? It seems nonsensical to me.",1582950191,31jn4,SexWorkersOnly,instead of bp sugaring sites like seeking arrangement should have been the ones targeted by fosta,"its a rant yall its a rant but also a concerning topic that doesnt get enough attention

289,705407,fjd477,r/pics is being infiltrated by attention-seeking parents.,"On the Reddit popular feed earlier today a picture of a guy's newborn son was posted for the whole world to see on r/pics and it was receiving criticism due to a flaw in the baby's seat strap and people just getting fed up with the ""Facebook"" like posts here on Reddit. I scrolled through the subreddit more and managed to find TWO other daddicts wanting to show their little newborn bundles of joys as if internet strangers really care about seeing babies that belong to complete strangers. There was also a photo of a persons 6-year old but at least at that age the child would have consent on whether they want a picture of themselves here on the internet or not. Pictures of literal newborns is very irresponsible and would ruin the privacy of that ""special"" moment. Is it so hard to only show close friends or relatives a picture of your new spawn instead of total and complete strangers in attempts to seek karma and validation for a thing that people literately do every. single. day?

So its a long story
I lost my virginity when I was 26, to a guy I was dating via tinder. It was a casual thing. So we broke up after a month and I had 1 hookup after tHat (idk why probably built up hornyness). When he learns that he’s like I want you back and after a month he confesses that he loves me so we start to date again and he’s like I want to marry you and all. We are in long distance relationship so I’m like yeah let’s wait about this marriage and all. After a month I tell him I love him too (idk why) and we are having good time. Then our conversation starts to get shitty (we had amazing communication between us). Then we are like not sure about this and decide to meet on new year and see things thru, we meet and decide to stay together. After 20 days first girl coworker comes to his office and he said he wants to fuck her (refer above we talked about everything) and I’m like ok then go and fuck her and he actually does it. We break up the same day. 
Next phase in my life I go back to just hooking up with people and for next 5-6 months Hooked up with around 6 people I guess. Then I met another guy who wanted to date me and we dated and then he decided to move to his hometown and we spilt up but still are good friends. Now as for me I’m back to hook ups. 

Then I met another amazing guy let’s talk him D. But there was a problem to being with although he’s an atheist like me he used to be Muslim so that’s like still a Muslim for our people here. They don’t care that you are an atheist. Anyway I really like this guy and we meet and have amazing time emotionally and sexually. So I decided to stop hooking up with people. Fast forward 2 months we are still talking a lot ( and I’m meeting other guys casually for coffee or something coz D and I haven’t talked about anything on the lines of dating and all).
In these 2 months I get to know he’s still super into his ex. That he’s been in love with from past 10 years and they can’t get married because he’s a Muslim. And he casually keeps saying things to me like “ I really like you” and a few instances said “I love you while being drunk “. I tried to ask him weather he likes me and wants us to do something about it and he declines it completely. So I’m like ok don’t want to get involved in this although I like him a ton.
So I start hooking up again and meeting D too. I used to tell D that I’m seeing others too but never specified that I’m sleeping with people or I have slept with people while taking to you. 
At last I tell him in detail that I have slept with people but I really like you and I don’t want to do anything like that anymore to get my side clear.

And he’s like if you liked me then why did you hookup with other people. I don’t have any answer to this may be because I didn’t know for sure and I just want into hooking up but meeting him changed something in me made me emotionally weak and more into him. It’s been a year since I haven’t slept with Anyone deleted all my contacts of those people. Confessed that I loved D to his face. 
But all I hear is “you Hooked up with those people while taking to me”
D and I have practically lived together for 6 months. Still whenever he’s angry all I hear is “you go back to what suits you”
He still hasn’t said that he likes me in a relationship sort of way. We still aren’t in a relationship. He still says that we are free to do whatever. But I love him now and don’t want to be with anyone’ else. 
But all most all time it’s like “you slept with those people “
One day he was angry as he saw some insta messages while he was looking through my phone while I was black out drunk (they were messages from tinder guy normally chatting and asking questions like have you had a threesome only one question was like this rest all normal how you doing types). So next day he’s pissed and is like let me fuck you and I’m like no you are angry then he says “you can show your boobs to all of those people and not me” this one hit me hard. I have never said no to him ever mostly in terms of sex but that day I decided I’ll let me do whatever he wants with me. 
Still after a year that statement comes up “you go back to doing what you are good at”

I don’t know what to do I deeply love him. He takes care of me very well but then all this comes up.
But I feel like shit. This is not the whole Story. But idol how much I can explain here it’s all jumbled up.



TL;DR! - I’m with a person whom I love and he doesn’t love me and is fixed on my past. But he really takes care of me all the time.",1584208594,2qjvn,relationships,28f   need your advise   it can help me a lot,"

one day he was angry as he saw some insta messages while he was looking through my phone while i was black out drunk they were messages from tinder guy normally chatting and asking questions like have you had a threesome only one question was like this rest all normal how you doing types  so next day hes pissed and is like let me fuck you and im like no you are angry then he says you can show your boobs to all of those people and not me this one hit me hard  i have never said no to him ever mostly in terms of sex but that day i decided ill let me do whatever he wants with me  
still after a year that statement comes up you go back to doing what you are good at

i dont know what to do i deeply love him  he takes care of me very well but then all this comes up 
but i feel like shit  this is not the whole story  but idol how much i can explain here its all jumbled up

Anyways, to do this, you need a fat man, a mini nuke (any type, though I personally prefer the big kid mini nukes), and the laser detonator from lonesome road.

First, you select the fat man

Next, press and hold the hotkey button and switch over to the ammo tab in your Pip-boy

Next, hotkey the mini nuke that you are using

Then, pull out the laser detonator and select the mini nukes you hotkeyed

And voila! You know have a weapon that fires mini nukes full-auto and has infinite ammo.

Here's a YouTube video that shows you how to do it, in case you're confused:

My mentor is a PhD who I was placed with based on availability who's focus mostly lies in behavior, which I am not interested in. Regardless, I like taking charge of the molecular work she needs done like qPCR and reverse transcription because that's what I find fun and interesting, so its okay. 

The atmosphere in the lab is so uncomfortable. I always get incredibly nervous when I ask anyone for help because it feels like I'm bothering them. When I make mistakes, whether its managing my time poorly (a recurring problem) or make a procedural error, I feel and am made to feel terrible about it. My mentor doesn't always feel supportive because I can tell she's often stressed about work and her own life, and I get that. A big reason I joined this lab was for the benefits that the PI's Nobel Laureate letter of recommendation could bring, but he is very unapproachable. My mentor would write the letter to be signed by him, but I can't even say if it would be worth much. I've talked to her a few times about changes that I felt needed to be made, like reducing hours I work or more face to face time, both of which have helped. She's a nice person and I feel okay about working with her now, but I can't shake the heart rate spike every time I walk in to the science center.

I don't feel good about the impact I've made here and I'm uncomfortable every time I come in to work.  The work does not align with my interests, but honestly very few of the labs at this school do. I don't know if it's worth sticking out for two more years, I feel like I could do it though. How worth it is this letter? The experience has been super valuable too, but nothing else in my life has ever made me cry from stress so much. I'm trying to work elsewhere this summer so I can breather and do a senior thesis next year. I've been thinking about this for four months now; what should drive me to look to work in a different lab? When does it stop being worth it? I don't want to throw away such a good opportunity.

TL;DR - Joined a top lab for the experience and letter of rec. I feel so uncomfortable though, am not particularly engaged with the subject of study, and am generally very stressed. How can I make sure it's still worth it for me?",1583120756,2qhn7,biology,undergrad in a great research lab that i dont like,"hey all ive been super stuck recently

208,2364349,ff0u7z,Need suggestions for how to re-enter the work world gently & slowly,"Has anyone here slowly re-entered the work world? Can you advise me? I need to do this so I can leave my husband. (Want to leave before his inheritance runs out.) I do have financial support to some degree so I can take some time to test the waters. I want to do this in a way that’s as easy on my nervous system as possible.

I haven’t worked since 2003 when I give birth to our son and my world came crashing down: chronic illness, special needs child, gaslighting from my husband that I just recognized this week.

I have an undergrad degree from a big name school but I have some shame around not being able to manage work relationships due to cPTSD so I never held a job more than 2.5 years. I also don’t have the career that would be expected from someone with my degree and intelligence.

I’ve done a lot of admin work and I’m good at it. I just need a low stress, low deadline situation. 

Also, Expenses are very high here.

I’m training in SE which I love however I’m not a therapist and I feel skittish about building my practice around my astrology profession due to how I think I’ll be perceived. I waffle back and forth on this. Plus, SE won’t work quickly enough for a highly traumatized person to do an astrology reading with it. It’ll work great for those less traumatized and those who already receive SE. Astrology is also kind of a tough business since people usually think of astrology as a one time or once per year thing. I don’t have the bandwidth to be selling myself that much, that often.

I’ve considered getting a therapist on my insurance to help. I don’t want to work with my regular trauma therapist on this because we’re working on my Developmental Trauma. He’d be awesome but it would mean taking away time from the work that has gotten me this far.

Any supportive ideas or thoughts appreciated.",1583612326,2vvid,CPTSD,need suggestions for how to re enter the work world gently  slowly,"has anyone here slowly re entered the work world  can you advise me  i need to do this so i can leave my husband  want to leave before his inheritance runs out  i do have financial support to some degree so i can take some time to test the waters  i want to do this in a way thats as easy on my nervous system as possible

I'm unsure if the actual physical size of the tent matters.

On one side, if a tent has less volume, the fan will be able to exhaust the hot air more frequently then in a bigger tent.

But a bigger tent holds more air and the heat has more volume to expand to, thus lowering the overall temperature.

664,3007026,fb36l9,First time doing hip thrust with the 45 plates and claiming a big barbell (as opposed to the smaller fixed weight ones),"I just finished bootyful beginnings and just started the 3 day split in glute lab since I'm trying to work on some running stuff, too. Friday/day 3 is supposed to be a heavy day (typically 4 sets of 3) and I was trying to find what weight I needed to do for this (in BB I was up to 80 pounds of the...I'm calling them the mini barbells. So those). I kept increasing each set until I finished at 115lbs. None of this felt like the necessary effort so I decided to just go for the full plates and see what happened.

Y'all! I did it! I did it for 5 reps!

The other victory is claiming the big barbell for this exercise. One of the reasons I hadn't tried to go past 80 pounds before was because after that I struggled with getting the fixed weight barbells not only from their stand to a bench but then onto my hips because their wasn't enough space to roll them over me. I was reluctant to use the big barbell where you manually set the weight because ""those are for squats or deadlifts or bench presses and belong with the rack or bench"". Like I felt like I shouldn't use it when there are fixed weight barbells I could use and not inconvenience people. So I got over that when I realized that, at the very least, I needed to be able to roll the barbell over me. 

I'm not sure I'm explaining well what was happening in my head about feeling like I couldn't use the big barbell but the TLDR is that I beat some imposter syndrome with the gym. I'm delighted so free imaginary protein cookies for everybody.

Also this has made me realize that I may be *drastically* underestimating what I can lift in the gym. Though I still can't deadlift 135 even if I can hip thrust it lol. I gave it a try since the barbell was all set up. That's still at about 75 pounds. *Or is it?* Tune in next week for the exciting conclusion! Actually don't because I'll forget I said that.

A shark-like head with “pointy hears” at the back end and a pair of eyes almost on the sides which lets them see quite a bit more than 180º of the normal peripherical vision. 

Being a semiaquatic egg-laying mammal, the newborns are most of the time completely pale, pitch black and/or have faint traces of the colors of the parents. Their color is very important as it says much of their habits and lifestyles: a blue colored Krygnym would be instantly recognized as one of the fishers that live near shores and the like, while having a more green-ish tone to the blue will reflect that it’s a traveler or that it eats an incredible amount of plants, another example are the Purple ones that guard the Giant Nest in the middle of their territory, they got their color from the blood of the Earthlings that often try to raid the Nest. They all have amazing learning potential, some of them, can be as smart as a mage or even beyond them, like their King and Queen. 

Those that does not live near the boundaries of the Nest are those that have the life of a traveler, Fishers that live near shores and beaches and the ones that live among the humans or the Cloudians as equals. They can have many cultural differences between settlements but the one thing that they all share is that the Brighter the color on a Female is the more appealing to most of the Males is. And for the Males to attract a Female they need to be talented, whether it be Strength, “the arts of men” or fishing, at the end of the day it’s a decision of the Females, also while quite rare, is the other way around, a talented Female could attract many Males and a Bright colored male could be what a Female is looking for.  

While the age of their leaders (The Red King and Pale Queen) is unknow, it doesn’t seem to bother them. The average lifespan of a “Krygnym” is 120 human years, reaching full adulthood at the age of 16, and prime at their 40-50, Rumors are passed between Humans and Earthlings that say that The Red Thunder (King) and The Pale Lightning (Queen) have around Five Thousand years on them. 

Krygnym, Humans, Cloudians and Earthlings do not write in the same language, making a natural cultural barrier that is difficult to break with “commoners” of a race. 

The Krygnym hold in big regard the succession of themselves, maybe not someone that can do exactly the same as themselves, but someone that is there for when they are not (more of an Natural Urge than Heritage), that said, polygamy and relations with other species are not prohibited, but are not well received by other Krygnym, meaning that those who do end up on a relationship with another species are usually banished from its hometown, not out of fear or purism but as a test for the exiled one, if they truly have made their mind up, then they’ll have no reason to go back any time soon. Couples of two Males or Females are also rare, but not at all rejected, since some females can grow up their bodies to resemble the male ones on muscles and size (and vice-versa), they have a pretty hard time finding mates, so they resort to getting a companion of the same gender, after that, it is possible that both parts of these couples agree that one of them is to mate with another member of the settlement in order to have a successor, this mate is often really similar to one of the parners. 

**The Shadows,** rare but powerful Krygnym, these are Krygnyms that are born using a certain type of magical light during the second half of the embryo development. This light was a type of magic derived from **Dulener, Goddess of the Dead**, that make the Krygnyms have an ethereal body that emitted no light making them a matte pitch black, this was considered a crime against life since it made the newborn a completely obedient slave, but a millennium ago a mage found a way to make the Shadow gain only the ethereal form without losing any of it “living” features, with that out of the way it’s still a very dangerous process that could kill the caster and/or the “vessel”. 

While the Krygnym have a Neutral relationship with Humans and Cloudians, they have a natural hate for Earthlings, its unknow when the hostility reached practically genetic levels, but some of what is known is that earthlings have a coliseum in which Krygnym face Earthlings or others of Krygnym which definitely does not help with the hostility of the Krygnym, some of this Krygnyms have never seen or talked with another one of their race and often Shadows or a rescue team is formed to release these Krygnym. 

Mortal enemies of the Earthlings a dark skinned “human” that are way different than normal humans mainly in physical power, a normal human will never be able to fight an adult Krygnym bare handed, while the Earthlings could deal some damage at the very least.

I'm a Ph.D. student at the  University of Brasília (UNB), Brazil. We are currently investigating the benefits and implications of using lambda expressions in Java programs so that we could later improve existing tools that automatically refactor legacy code to introduce lambda expressions.

As part of our research, we are conducting a survey that collects the developers' perceptions of a couple of transformations recommended by tools to refactor either an anonymous inner class or a for-loop into lambda expressions and streams. It would be of great help if you could answer this survey, which does not take too much time (5 minutes on average). Your participation is voluntary and confidential. You might withdraw at any time. The link for the survey is http://qarefactoring.com/

We will make our results (data sets, data analysis, and tools) publicly available.  Thank you so much for your time, and please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

as part of our research we are conducting a survey that collects the developers perceptions of a couple of transformations recommended by tools to refactor either an anonymous inner class or a for loop into lambda expressions and streams  it would be of great help if you could answer this survey which does not take too much time 5 minutes on average  your participation is voluntary and confidential  you might withdraw at any time  the link for the survey is httpqarefactoring com

we will make our results data sets data analysis and tools publicly available   thank you so much for your time and please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions

347,3206082,f77raz,"The situation with ranged supports top, a closer look at the real issue","A lot of people, and this includes and underscores Riot themselves, don't fully understand why ranged supports have been plaguing top even before preseason - and if you look back at old data, stuff like Soraka and Sona top were already played top with great success, during a time the majority of the playerbase didn't understand how hypercarrying via enabling teammates works as well as it does.

Some say it's because top lane is an island.

Some say it's because there are no real objectives to contest at top(and by extension it doesn't matter if you don't have lane priority as a support).

Some say it's because of Spellthief's Edge being usable in a solo lane.

Some say it's because the meta top laners have limited kill potential against melee matchups as is, so it's even worse when they are up against ranged matchups because they can play further back relative to the lane.

Some say it's because supports take much less to come online; they not only have significantly cheaper itemization that is also simultaneously more impactful than straight-out carry itemization, them taking a solo lane slot greatly mitigates their problems with survivability because they level faster and hit certain level breakpoints quicker(lvl 11 sona powerspike comes to mind, as well as ranged supports famous for being squishy mitigated by more levels).

Some say it's because of how effective funneling is, especially when compared to the recent perceived weakness in the jungle role.

And my answer? ***It's all of them - and more.***

It's a deeply nuanced and multi-faceted problem that mutated across multiple patches, and doesn't have a single easy solution that Riot can just nerfbat the more visible outliers like Soraka and Sona and call it a day.

This can be made evident that even if Riot eventually destroys Soraka and Sona, there's still Karma. There's still Lulu, Nami, Morgana and Janna; ***that the playerbase have been largely sleeping on the fact that literally all the ranged enchanters are ranging from perfectly viable to batshit oppressive in the top lane role.***

Don't believe me? Look up all their respective winrates at top, and/or give it a shot yourself and play all them like you would with Sona top. Don't get me started on how Spellthief's Edge or any singular balance points are not the end-all-be-all problem, because standard starts like Doran's Ring have been proven to be perfectly viable on Sona and Soraka. It's merely one isolated and tiny piece of the puzzle.

**So unless Riot wants to completely dismantle all the ranged supports(and by extension destroy them in their intended role too), they need to work on all the facets of the problem rather than just play balance whack-a-mole with each enchanter flavor of the month that pops up.**

882,1402020,fb4rwf,65 Dungeon Cap," 

Hey DECA, this update was really hype when I read it but that last bit, changing the dungeon cap from 85 to 65 is really getting on my nerves now, Lost Halls is a dungeon that takes time, and yes you increased rates to make it a little more rewarding (unique loot-wise) but as someone with slight lag, and always making it to 85 man runs, it's such a pain to get downgraded to almost never making any runs unless a discord server goes into quiet runs (but then again, Aus players have it hard).

It ends up wasting more people's time, like for me, I just want to do 3lh for the day and get the chest sometimes, like today, but I kinda can't when the dungeon is full as fk. I urge you to change back to 85, I'd rather steamroll a dungeon than waste my time doing almost none of the dungeon.

3 hurdles

1. For Aus players, timezones can be annoying so runs are iffy there.
2. Aus player, a bit more lag hopping servers so you miss runs more.
3. Now have to wait for a discord to not be so packed, on their quiet times, or when there are lots of raid leaders.

41,3788047,f59vsy,Looking for decent frontliner MC,"Hi,Right now I'm Sword Saint lvl 6 (almost 7) and I have to say I do not like it. The fact that I need to constantly toggle off/on his skills and at least early levels he is not that powerful with his spells and can have max lvl 6 spells. I'm just not feeling it. I was thinking about rerolling to another class but the thing is I'm not sure which Class would best mix into my party composition:

MC: Sword SaintValerieAmari (Mad Dog so have an animal companion)TristianLinziOctavia (Arcane Trickster)

Valerie is, of course, the main tank and Amari is also quite tanky (26 ac at lvl 6, nothing special but not that worse I think). SS is quite tanky and if buffed he can stand quite long but his HP is not highest and I have to say I'm just now enjoying it so much.I would like to stay with Tristian/Linzi/Octavia because 1st is a great healer and can buff nicely but of course, he is not that tanky as Harrim but can cast/heal much more.

So I guess my MC should be frontliner but I'm not sure which one. I was thinking about Paladin(not sure about subclass) because it is nice to have those good saves against Fear and there are some nice group buffs/auras (group Mark of Justice)

Druid (Defender of Tru World) - not sure if he can stand in 1st line next to Amari and Valerie. I've heard the late game is full of Fey enemies so I think he can be nice addition besides he looks cool on paper. He also can summon a lot and summons are quite good, especially in early and mid game?

Melee Kineticist - Just read something he can be frontliner and can deal nice damage and that he can be a great opener to a lot of fights. Kinetic Knight can be pretty tanky and maybe even do more dmg than Valerie? Earth as first element and water later?

Sylvan Sorcerer (another animal companion and he is OP as far as I've heard because summons are still op?)Human Flame Spirit Shaman?Pure Occultist?

FWB situation, great sex and chemistry and I do care about her... she got a pussy injury from riding a bike and who knows whatever other factors. She showed me 2 days ago and it did look pretty bad so I didn’t push the sex just got some hand and suck work. I’ve done some research and I know what she has, and I have a list of potential therapeutic remedies to assist with pain, inflammation and antibacterial effects.

Two options, I can surprise her with the pussy care pack because I would like it to be better so we can have sex again (I can always go to someone else of course in the meantime) which obviously shows I do care to an extent. Or the other option is just wait for her to contact me when she’s better which she said she would let me know this next weekend (we usually hang out on weekends) so I just do my usual ghost during the week (I don’t text or talk to her usually).

Obviously I don’t mind ignoring it but does it make me look like too much of an asshole by not caring?

Keep in mind we are just FWB I don’t ask or care about whoever else she might be draining or getting filled with cum by, so if there are other people I can go with the assumption that they will care and do that part of this for me.

1st boss - The boss spawns Ice-lines over time. You can get freeze stacks by walking over them. They damage you if you stay on them. Make sure to build enough freeze stacks for the AOE phases over and over.
You can roll out of certain freezes, make sure you don't roll out of any during the AOE phases.
There is a poison phase in which a light will spawn in the middle of the room. Cleanse the poison by going in 1 by 1 and don't kill eachother by standing too close when you have the poison.

&nbsp;

2nd boss - Have 1 Guardian taunt the male away and 1 Guardian tank the female. Everyone is to focus the female. When mushrooms spawn around you, kill them right away, don't even wait a second.
Cleanse your poison stacks as much as possible, the stacks hit much harder.

&nbsp;


3rd boss - Time your cc break for the moment the boss stuns you, as AOE waves will spawn under you right after the stun; keep moving. Don't stand too close to others as you'll end up killing them with your AOE's.
The stacks you get from getting hit by the boss or which you can gather give you increased damage but decreases healing done & received. The Paladins should avoid getting stacks whereas everyone else should build up stacks.
As soon as the boss starts walking to the gate follow him with everyone in the party. Ignore those who are dead and focus on those that are alive. 
Once the boss has a shield around him just keep hitting him, after a certain amount of damage is done the shield will disappear.

&nbsp;

4th boss -  Group behind 1 of the towers at all times. Stay in 1 line After the big AOE cc break if you didn't jump, if you can time it jump so you don't turn into stone. After the tower phase, pick up 1 circle and jump into the boss, hit him and jump once to heal and repeat.

&nbsp;

Between 4th and 5th boss you'll have the color game. The color pattern is above the machine towers, note them down. Kill the mobs in the area and then pick the colors by walking over them according to the pattern.

&nbsp;

I'll update this with 5th and 6th boss at a later point as I haven't finished writing yet, I was thinking of showing the last 2 bosses in a video format so I might do that as well.

1st boss   the boss spawns ice lines over time  you can get freeze stacks by walking over them  they damage you if you stay on them  make sure to build enough freeze stacks for the aoe phases over and over 
you can roll out of certain freezes make sure you dont roll out of any during the aoe phases 
there is a poison phase in which a light will spawn in the middle of the room  cleanse the poison by going in 1 by 1 and dont kill eachother by standing too close when you have the poison 

nbsp

2nd boss   have 1 guardian taunt the male away and 1 guardian tank the female  everyone is to focus the female  when mushrooms spawn around you kill them right away dont even wait a second 
cleanse your poison stacks as much as possible the stacks hit much harder 

nbsp


3rd boss   time your cc break for the moment the boss stuns you as aoe waves will spawn under you right after the stun keep moving  dont stand too close to others as youll end up killing them with your aoes 
the stacks you get from getting hit by the boss or which you can gather give you increased damage but decreases healing done  received  the paladins should avoid getting stacks whereas everyone else should build up stacks 
as soon as the boss starts walking to the gate follow him with everyone in the party  ignore those who are dead and focus on those that are alive  
once the boss has a shield around him just keep hitting him after a certain amount of damage is done the shield will disappear 

nbsp

4th boss    group behind 1 of the towers at all times  stay in 1 line after the big aoe cc break if you didnt jump if you can time it jump so you dont turn into stone  after the tower phase pick up 1 circle and jump into the boss hit him and jump once to heal and repeat 

nbsp

between 4th and 5th boss youll have the color game  the color pattern is above the machine towers note them down  kill the mobs in the area and then pick the colors by walking over them according to the pattern

This PC will be used in an academic research environment to process movies of molecules taken over long time spans (10+ hours, resulting in very large movie files). The software we use runs on Linux, and I'm not sure if there are any compatibility concerns with the parts below. The requirements for the build are as follows:

* 2x RTX 2080 Ti graphics cards
* Intel Core i9 processor (9900K? 9900X? 10900X? More on that below)
* 128 GB RAM
* 2 TB SSD for primary data processing, >=10 TB HDD for storing data

Our budget is ~$5k. I am in the US.

**Some specific comments/questions/concerns.**

* I went with and LGA2066 motherboard because I have read that LGA1151 motherboards are limited to 64 GB RAM. Is this outdated info, or is it even true? I'm finding conflicting info online.

* I specifically chose the i9-9900X over the i9-10900X because a BIOS update is required for my chosen motherboard to work with Cascade Lake-X CPUs, and I will not have access to any older LGA2066 CPUs to perform the update.

* Are there any concerns about compatibility of any parts listed above with Linux OS, particularly the motherboard? I've never built a Linux PC, or even really used Linux, so I have no idea if this is something I need to be concerned about.

thanks in advance for your help and advice ","[96, 15, 384, 510, 325, 10, 508, 3243, 17, 9, 13, 101, 65, 1494, 107, 1, 5, 485, 5, 1201, 42, 7, 2, 1087, 240, 6, 10184, 198, 1904, 1, 256, 251, 33, 56, 26, 162, 9, 863, 691, 510, 46, 21, 179, 8, 41, 4513, 436, 1032, 3, 663, 2079, 7, 10185, 764, 121, 168, 65, 10186, 209, 441, 4120, 8, 125, 562, 2505, 1121, 1, 2, 530, 44, 106, 876, 14, 384, 6, 30, 27, 154, 26, 47, 22, 50, 4823, 1018, 15, 2, 714, 869, 1, 2, 2267, 10, 2, 325, 22, 24, 10187, 10188, 1236, 1237, 1572, 1970, 10189, 1599, 500, 1571, 4824, 4815, 1, 2425, 1, 4825, 1, 66, 14, 12, 10190, 10191, 243, 10192, 91, 1931, 3244, 10, 3041, 508, 3243, 209, 1931, 10193, 10, 10194, 10195, 1068, 9, 3539, 1, 5, 68, 8, 2, 156, 4819, 9, 13, 10196, 361, 10197, 10198, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4826, 1, 1599, 500, 1571, 2425, 137, 146, 2614, 209, 500, 10199, 10200, 500, 1571, 2425, 1573, 2614, 209, 500, 4824, 10201, 1, 10202, 10203, 1, 416, 4826, 2773, 1, 10204, 10205, 10206, 10207, 2042, 10208, 857, 10209, 10210, 857, 2773, 10211, 1, 4827, 10212, 1, 416, 10213, 1, 1969, 3245, 3246, 222, 520, 2426, 2427, 10214, 10215, 3245, 3246, 222, 520, 2426, 2427, 1664, 3245, 3246, 222, 520, 1, 10216, 644, 1, 4828, 1151, 1, 902, 1152, 1153, 305, 243, 84, 266, 305, 243, 956, 1010, 1154, 1155, 808, 1156, 1, 1157, 1158, 1, 416, 1151, 1, 902, 1152, 1153, 305, 243, 84, 266, 305, 243, 956, 1010, 1154, 1155, 808, 1156, 1, 1157, 1158, 1, 416, 1151, 1, 902, 1152, 1153, 305, 243, 84, 266, 305, 243, 956, 1010, 1154, 1155, 808, 1156, 1, 1157, 1158, 1, 416, 1151, 1, 902, 1152, 1153, 305, 243, 84, 266, 305, 243, 956, 1010, 1154, 1155, 808, 1156, 1, 1157, 1158, 1, 416, 1151, 1, 902, 1152, 1153, 305, 243, 84, 266, 305, 243, 956, 1010, 1154, 1155, 808, 1156, 1, 1157, 1158, 1, 416, 1151, 1, 902, 1152, 1153, 305, 243, 84, 266, 305, 243, 956, 1010, 1154, 1155, 808, 1156, 1, 1157, 1158, 1, 416, 1151, 1, 902, 1152, 1153, 305, 243, 84, 266, 305, 243, 956, 1010, 1154, 1155, 808, 1156, 1, 1157, 1158, 1, 416, 1151, 1, 902, 1152, 1153, 305, 243, 84, 266, 305, 243, 956, 1010, 1154, 1155, 808, 1156, 1, 1157, 1158, 1, 416, 4829, 1, 4778, 4830, 91, 1931, 91, 146, 1740, 635, 4831, 10217, 4830, 10218, 724, 1740, 635, 366, 10219, 1, 3832, 644, 1, 416, 4829, 1, 10220, 4832, 209, 1931, 137, 146, 4833, 1314, 214, 4831, 10221, 4832, 209, 1931, 1573, 4833, 1314, 214, 366, 10222, 1, 10223, 4834, 1, 416, 4835, 280, 1, 3240, 1372, 1236, 1237, 1572, 756, 243, 1930, 1806, 520, 273, 4836, 4837, 1372, 1236, 1237, 1572, 4838, 1930, 1806, 520, 273, 280, 4839, 4840, 4841, 4842, 91, 97, 4843, 1, 4844, 644, 1, 4845, 4835, 280, 1, 3240, 1372, 1236, 1237, 1572, 756, 243, 1930, 1806, 520, 273, 4836, 4837, 1372, 1236, 1237, 1572, 4838, 1930, 1806, 520, 273, 280, 4839, 4840, 4841, 4842, 91, 97, 4843, 1, 4844, 644, 1, 4845, 10224, 2225, 1, 10225, 1040, 1921, 10226, 1243, 603, 1921, 4846, 854, 4847, 2426, 563, 10227, 10228, 1040, 1921, 10229, 603, 1921, 4846, 854, 4847, 2426, 563, 2225, 10230, 10231, 1, 10232, 644, 1, 4828, 69, 1, 2765, 697, 887, 3187, 3247, 6, 10233, 69, 1, 735, 100, 1312, 8, 3247, 1, 10234, 4848, 1, 1312, 8, 3247, 1, 1, 363, 10235, 1, 735, 1, 10236, 4848, 1, 4134, 55, 10237, 693, 473, 10238, 305, 10239, 10240, 10241, 793, 617, 10242, 128, 5, 241, 15, 6, 2427, 1664, 73, 5, 16, 293, 12, 10243, 10244, 22, 914, 3, 2500, 243, 1663, 1, 9, 17, 10245, 692, 20, 9, 11, 85, 728, 1, 30, 699, 3713, 692, 327, 128, 5, 1826, 2703, 2, 1571, 2425, 121, 2, 1571, 4825, 73, 4, 10246, 497, 9, 1602, 10, 13, 2813, 1664, 3, 81, 15, 10247, 2700, 266, 4849, 6, 5, 46, 27, 16, 568, 3, 50, 1489, 2427, 4849, 3, 2023, 2, 497, 128, 22, 47, 50, 1018, 45, 4823, 7, 50, 714, 681, 804, 15, 384, 1373, 1830, 2, 1664, 1, 76, 157, 796, 4, 384, 510, 20, 85, 104, 179, 384, 25, 5, 16, 53, 283, 26, 17, 9, 95, 5, 89, 3, 21, 1761, 45, 1, 622, 8, 682, 10, 63, 96, 6, 559, 1]",266

* CPU performance +/- just as good as highest end 3-4rd gen i7 AND can be upgraded to 6 or 8 core Xeon  
* Takes almost any GPU. From GT 710 to RTX 2080  
* ECC RAM is cheap as hell, 64 GB will cost you less than 16 GB non-ECC DDR4  
* Build quality and QoL stuff like hot swappable PSU or tool less installation  

And it still costs less than a current gen Ryzen 5/i5 with an ok motherboard!

 takes almost any gpu  from gt 710 to rtx 2080  
 ecc ram is cheap as hell 64 gb will cost you less than 16 gb non ecc ddr4  
 build quality and qol stuff like hot swappable psu or tool less installation  

and it still costs less than a current gen ryzen 5i5 with an ok motherboard   

do you need even more performance  there are dual cpu models like t5600 or hp z620

My grandmother has decided that the betta was her responsibility, despite telling her repeatedly for over a year to stop.

I know that police officers are to view cannabis as illegal under federal law and to have a zero tolerance approach to it. I am aware that police officers need to be sober while on-duty so that they have a clear mind to do their job properly. 

I know they are going to drug test me and I know that as a sworn cop, I can no longer partake.

It's tough that I have to give up this habit but it is the only issue stopping me from being an officer. My income is not sustainable at the moment and I have to move out of my mom's place which requires a modest income. 

I have thrown away my rig and accessories and will continue the path to sobriety as I plan on enrolling in the Police Academy.

388,2615640,ezcg69,Avengers Endgame: Dr. Strange Lied About Winning,"Hello! Been on this sub for a while, and today I strolled across more than one theory over Endgame. There are lots of things I can talk about, but I want to focus on a line that Dr. Strange stated. He said that he could not reveal the future, or else the future wouldn't happen. In Endgame however, Dr. Strange holds up one finger to Tony in order to symbolize that they are going to win, and because of this, Tony sacrificed himself so that the rest of the world could go on. Notice how Dr. Strange told Tony that they were going to win. If Strange really revealed this, they would've lost. Instead, I believe that Strange knew that they were going to lose, and in order to prevent this he used reverse psychology on Tony. This enabled Tony to have the courage to end his life in order to save hundreds of others.

424,441685,fadvja,Una idea per provare a regolare il flusso dell'immigrazione irregolare,"Ragionavo ieri sul problema e mi chiedevo se una soluzione come quella che propongo sotto possa funzionare meglio delle attuali ""non"" soluzioni. Può anche essere che questa cosa già esista o sia inattuabile, non sono un esperto in materia, ma avevo voglia di condividere.

Partiamo da alcuni postulati:

* l'immigrazione non è eliminabile
* l'immigrazione incontrollata non è desiderabile
* non sempre è possibile rimpatriare gli immigrati (es. Libia, Siria)

Questa la mia proposta:

1. l'immigrato in condizioni di difficoltà, si salva senza se e senza ma. L'emergenza va sempre risolta senza mettere a rischio la vita delle persone
2. Si definisce un numero massimo **N** di immigrati che possono essere gestiti in ingresso. Tale valore può essere ridefinito di anno in anno a seconda delle contingenze. I posti utilizzati in più/in meno si riflettono sull'anno successivo. Esempio: se N è 100.000 per il 2016 e il 2017 e nel 2016 sono entrate 80.000 persone, nel 2017 ne potranno entrare fino a 120.000. Se nel 2016 invece ne entrano 120.000, nel 2017 ne potranno entrare 80.000.
3. Ogni paese (o gruppo di paesi) ha assegnata una specifica quota **Q** di immigrati, calcolata a seconda del caso specifico. Esempi: immigrati ad alta scolarizzazione o ""necessari"" potrebbero non essere limitati da quote (=abbiamo bisogno di medici? Entrino pure). Paesi in guerra potrebbero usufruire di quote maggiori o esserne esenti (e quindi non influire neanche su N). Paesi normali e immigrati economici non particolarmente ""appetibili"" per la nostra economia invece contribuiscono alle quote Q e N
4. Per ogni ingresso, fino al raggiungimento delle quote Q dei vari paesi e della quota globale N, l'Italia si fa carico al 100% dei costi di integrazione (i famosi 30-35 Euro al giorno a crapa)
5. Allo sforamento della quota Q per un determinato paese, i costi di integrazione aggiuntivi vengono addebitati o all'immigrato stesso (versamento diretto o trattenimento di una quota dello stipendio qui in Italia) o tramite sanzioni economiche ai paesi di origine. Esempio: al Buthan abbiamo assegnato una quota Q di 1000 immigrati e ce ne arrivano invece 1200. L'Italia copre i costi per 1000 persone, i costi delle 200 ulteriori vanno ripartiti, sicché in questo esempio l'Italia coprirebbe l'83% dei costi totali e gli immigrati dovrebbero restituire mediamente il 17%, ovviamente a seconda delle condizioni di vita che trovano qua in Italia (se sei ricco paghi di più, se non puoi lavorare non paghi nulla). Se restano dei costi non coperti, verranno addebitati tramite sanzioni economiche al paese di origine (= tassa extra per esportare in Italia).
6. In ogni caso, allo sforamento delle quote N e Q, si attivano ancora più pesanti politiche di controllo e blocco degli ingressi, per scoraggiare al massimo gli abusi e gli sforamenti.

Gli effetti positivi che vedo sono:

* la popolazione ha a disposizione numeri più chiari sulla gestione del fenomeno dell'immigrazione. È più difficile mentire su cosa si è fatto dato che ci si può rapportare alle quote N e Q (es: erano quote accettabili o meno?) e si può confrontare quanto un governo ha avuto successo nel farle rispettare.
* immigrati e paesi di origine, ove possibile, vengono responsabilizzati nella gestione del fenomeno
* l'immigrato ""clandestino"" ha eventualmente la possibilità di ""acquistare"" il proprio soggiorno, di conseguenza ha un percorso chiaro e responsabilizzante di integrazione. Anche di fronte al resto della popolazione ha la sensazione di aver dato il suo contributo in modo ufficiale.
* I paesi di origine vengono incoraggiati a gestire un minimo il fenomeno anche dal loro lato, o pagano di tasca propria le conseguenze

It had started slow.

A research station here. A science outpost there. A new or struggling colony over in that place. Ships vanishing now and then. A few GalNet posts had to be censored for disturbing content. A few Universal Social Media posters had to be banned for violation of the Anti-Violence Statutes. Then gaps in GalNet started blossoming out on the Unified Outer Territories but nobody was that worried, half of those worlds were the UnUnified Races or the Uncivilized Races, some of whom had barely had star drive for a century.

But whispers started.

Something was out there. Something was wiping whole worlds away.

Those who whispered first found their posts wiped away with no explanation. Then they found their accounts more than banned, they were purged.

Then those who whispered started vanishing.

A Vuknaraa with 1.2 billion followers mentioned that her cousin out at a research station hadn't GalNetted her in over a year.

Less than an hour later she was gone. Not just from GalNet.

Her luxury apartment, with eight private rooms, was empty and for purchase.

A Tnvaru shipping magnate mentioned to some friends at dinner that his second cousin, who had established a colony three years ago, had missed her last six shipping deadlines.

He vanished without a tuft of fur.

The dull gray vehicles of the Executors were seen. Those who recorded them vanished.

Then it happened. A capital world started screaming. Video, audio, text, pictures, flooded GalNet with the governor's code attached so that it couldn't be supressed without wiping out whole nodes of GalNet, which the Unified Science Council would never allow.

Beings watched in horror as ships fired from orbit, boiling away oceans, turning the very atmosphere to plasma fire, turning the exposed bedrock of the planets to glass. Massive war machines landed on planets, disgorging smaller ones, that began swarming cities and killing all who inhabited it.

They didn't just kill.

Killing was clean. Killing was quick.

Most machines, by accident or design, just killed.

These machines murdered.

The video of a sobbing Inhamahn brood mother, an EVR rig sloppily put onto her, the skullcap held in place by jagged shards of metal, being held in cold steel claws and being watched as each egg was smashed, the insides smeared across her feathers and beak, before her head was twisted off from the body, had over 1.2 *trillion* views on GalNet before the EVR video was wiped away.

It wasn't recorded by a bystander.

The machines themselves had recorded it.

Recorded her despair on EVR.

Had preserved every egg being broken, every unborn chick being crushed, every iota of her pain.

And posted in GalNet.

Every post, every video, ever picture, every audio file, all had the same header.

**THERE IS ONLY ENOUGH FOR ONE**

Audio of an entire city of 1.2 billion Savashan screaming in pain and agony was overlaid across the Unified Executor Council's broadcast for calm, over their claim that rogue hackers were simply trying to alarm people.

Before 12.5 trillion viewers the twelve council speakers were each overlaid with smaller videos of a member of their race not only being killed.

But being murdered.

The code that overrode the broadcast turned out to be a high level intelligence agencies disaster code from a world that had gone silent months before.

Random pictures and videos started having horror attached. A random advertisement for an air vehicle would have the vehicle suddenly massacre the happy family, with complete EVR of how it felt to be part of them. A simple picture of a sunset suddenly warped and showed a metal claw crushing a screaming Elmetankii.

The Chief Executor's, a Savashan with glossy scales and a thick tail, made an announcement watched by trillions that everything was under control. His image was suddenly replaced by a tiny unborn Savashan being pulled from its egg by a barbed needle, the tiny saurian squirming before plasma roasted it alive even as the Chief Executor's voice droned on and anyone with EVR felt the infant's confusion and agony replace the Chief Executor's calm and confidence.

The victim had the colors of the Chief Executor's brood.

Planetary governments began screaming for protection, demanding that the Unified Military Fleet protect their worlds, no matter how far from the encroaching blackness they were.

The fact that there wasn't enough ships in all of the Fleet to post a single ship at even a 10th of the worlds was leaked onto GalNet public information boards before the Unified Military Fleet could even make a decision.

The Unified Military Fleet was ordered to protect the Core Worlds, the oldest worlds, of the most powerful and wealthy of the Unified Civilized Races. Some ships mutinied, heading for the home worlds of the majority of the crew.

Others vanished into jumpspace and were never seen again.

Riots started, sweeping over major cities. Government officials and peacekeepers were killed where the mobs found them. GalNet was awash with video of the riots, taken from the omnipresent cameras. Those hunted by the rioters found their locations being reported on GalNet.

And the location of their families.

Their killings were broadcasted live.

GalNet became a horror show.

Then the virii attacked. Slashing into databases, from lowly cooking recipes to high end corporate research R&D databases. They were everywhere.

And they knew how to kill any who wore EVR.

Horribly.

GalNet became a war-zone where the virii, self-replicating and evolving, attacking everything from public transport to person to person calls.

One place fought back.

They erected barricades of neon and chrome, raised up firewalls of streaming green code, and attacked back.

Code that worked within a simple game worked outside, on GalNet itself, but it had to be guided, had to be *used* to be effective. It required will.

From out of a simple game poured tens of millions to fight.

Battlefields were strewn with the gasping avatars of dying players and the scattered prisms of defeated virii. Foxholes were dug into shattered infostores, berms erected inside Social Media chat rooms littered with the dead, aid stations built in the wreckage of traffic control systems.

They were defeated, no matter how valiant they were, more often then they won.

They still fought on. Climbing over their dead and wounded, taking the fight to the virii.

But the message had gone out.

Then, one day, for no particular reason at all, a diplomat was shot in the head.

In GalNet, in bunkers of chrome and neon, in fortifications of streaming green code, in foxholes dug into shattered databases, the word went out.

HOLD THE LINE, CHUMMERS!

WE'RE COMING!

\--------------------

Kuldunaat stood on the bridge of the *Gentle Mercy of Untaraa* with his hooves braced and his coat expertly manicured. His hooves shown, his sash of leadership glittered with medals, his feeding tentacles were plump with confidence, his jowls mighty and pendulous. His six eyes, two in back, two to the sides, two in front, were clear and focused as he waited with confidence for the First Communications Technician to tell him a message was waiting.

The four scanning techs, all of the First Class Order, were still staring at the screens, plying their scanners and displays for the smallest iota of data, the faintest wisp of ion trail, the faintest ping of jumpspace energy.

On the display was a fleet. It annoyed Kuldunaat, High Executor of the Unified Executor's Fleet, that the ships on the display outnumbered him.

It was most vexing that over half of them were larger even than his flagship.

""Harumph, put them on screen, they've waited long enough,"" He intoned, his tendrils trembling with amusement as he lifted his crest into an authoritative position.

The screen switched from showing those strangely arrayed ships, so different from the elegant and overwhelming line of his ships, to showing a bridge full of...

...of primates.

And not halfway civilized primates, but ones with forward facing eyes, almost furless except for what was on their heads. Two had no hair on their heads but instead their scalps were smooth and gleamed in the light. They all wore uniforms, stark uniforms made for utility rather than to properly show a being's rank and position.

Not a sash to be seen.

The centered primate, a bald one, simply stared at Kuldunaat. To his right one of the primates was smirking, hair around his mouth as he crossed his legs.

""May we come in?"" The bald one asked.

""Harumph, I think not,"" Kuldunaat said. ""Who am I speaking to?""

""Admiral Krempin, Terran Confederate Navy,"" The being said. Rather than continue on with his species, his rank, and his position, he simply leaned back and waited.

""Why are you here?"" Kuldunaat said.

A small window opened up, crackling into being. A figure wearing a set of armor with thick plates appeared. It was obviously female, a mix of primate and feline, and her eyes were replaced by swirling spirals. Little animated fists waved over her head and steam shot from the cracks of her thick plated armor.

""DOKI DOKI DOKI!"" the little figure squeaked.

One of the primates that had first appeared touched the panel in front of them and the strange window vanished.

""Apologies. Some of my troops are over-stimulated at the idea of assisting you,"" The bald primate said.

The one with hair on his face smirked wider.

""Why are you here?"" Kuldunaat said, harumphing again.

""To render assistance. Are you a representative of your government?"" The primate, Admiral Krempin asked mildly, as if he was inquiring about the weather.

""I am the High Executor of the Unified Executor's Fleet, the most learned and powerful Kuldunaat. And why do you think we need assistance?"" Kuldunaat asked.

The words ""DOKI DOKI DOKI"" danced at the edge of the viewscreen, with ""WAAAAAAGH!"" floating up from the bottom and ""FOR THE EMPEROR!"" streaming down the other side.

The same primate as before made a motion on her board and the sets of symbols vanished.

""Again, pardon. My troops are eager to assist,"" Admiral Krempin said again.

The smirker smirked harder. He was really starting to get on Kuldunaat's nerves. It was like he knew that when Kuldunaat was a child he had stolen a schoolmate's lunch and eaten it before blaming it on another.

""And again, I ask of you, what makes you think we need assistance?"" Kuldunaat asked.

Twelve thousand light years away an inversion charge turned a city of 250 million into ash.

Over a period five minutes.

The city's screams were recorded and broadcast onto GalNet.

""From what we have observed and learned, you have a Precursor problem,"" The Admiral said.

The smirker kept smirking. Now Kuldunaat could swear he could see the slightest suggestion of a hint of bared teeth.

He was really yanking on Kuldunaat's tendrils.

""The Precursor's have been dead for over a hundred million years,"" Kuldunaat scoffed.

""But their war machines are not,"" The Admiral said, making a basic primate shrug. ""Right now, they're massacring your people.""

""That is baseless foundless panic inducing rumors! That is disgusting anti-Executor propa..."" the High Executor cut off as the female feline-primate hybrid, reduced to a cartoon, ran onto the screen.

The Admiral held his hand up and stopped her by placing his palm against her cartoon forehead. She flailed against the air like she was actually there and trying to strike at him past his hand.

""DOKI DOKI DOKI WAAAAAAARRRRGH!"" the little cat-hybrid shrieked in a high pitched voice that made Kuldunaat and most of the rest of the bridge crew wince.

The Admiral turned slightly, pursed his lips, and blew.

The little hybrid in the heavy ornate power armor with overly thick plates tumbled off the screen.

""For a rumor they seem to be burning your systems at a rapid pace,"" The Admiral said. He stood up, leaning forward slightly, and the smirker's smirk got smirkier. ""You let them get a foothold and now your systems are infested.""

His eyes got intent.

""May we come in?"" He asked.

Kulumaat opened his mouth to deny this annoying uncivilized brute when the door to the lift opened up. A dozen Savashan rushed the bridge, waving small arms taken from the security armory.

""YES! YES! COME IN! WE REQUIRE ASSISTANCE!"" One screamed. ""HELP US!""

""That's good enough for me,"" The Admiral said, leaning back.

A cartoon version of the Savashan, a lowly Janitorial Technician Fifth Class, appeared on the screen, lifted up in celebration by cartoon heavily muscled green primates with overly large tusks, the green primates wearing stuck together metal plates painted red and yellow and firing weapons into the air in joy at the word WAAAAGH appeared over the Savashan. They paraded the Savashan back and forth as dozens of little armored cat/primate hybrids ran around him waving tufts of multicolored plastic strips and throwing hearts and sparkles into the air.

The screen went dark.

""HOW DARE Y..."" Kulumaat started to say.

His bridge captain, an  Inhamahn  , smoothly drew her pistol and shot Kulumaat in the back of the head.

The last thing that appeared in Kulumaat's darkening vision was the face of the smirker.

Smirking.

it had started slow 

a research station here  a science outpost there  a new or struggling colony over in that place  ships vanishing now and then  a few galnet posts had to be censored for disturbing content  a few universal social media posters had to be banned for violation of the anti violence statutes  then gaps in galnet started blossoming out on the unified outer territories but nobody was that worried half of those worlds were the ununified races or the uncivilized races some of whom had barely had star drive for a century 

but whispers started 

something was out there  something was wiping whole worlds away 

those who whispered first found their posts wiped away with no explanation  then they found their accounts more than banned they were purged 

then those who whispered started vanishing 

a vuknaraa with 1 2 billion followers mentioned that her cousin out at a research station hadnt galnetted her in over a year 

less than an hour later she was gone  not just from galnet 

her luxury apartment with eight private rooms was empty and for purchase 

a tnvaru shipping magnate mentioned to some friends at dinner that his second cousin who had established a colony three years ago had missed her last six shipping deadlines 

he vanished without a tuft of fur 

the dull gray vehicles of the executors were seen  those who recorded them vanished 

then it happened  a capital world started screaming  video audio text pictures flooded galnet with the governors code attached so that it couldnt be supressed without wiping out whole nodes of galnet which the unified science council would never allow 

beings watched in horror as ships fired from orbit boiling away oceans turning the very atmosphere to plasma fire turning the exposed bedrock of the planets to glass  massive war machines landed on planets disgorging smaller ones that began swarming cities and killing all who inhabited it 

they didnt just kill 

killing was clean  killing was quick 

most machines by accident or design just killed 

these machines murdered 

the video of a sobbing inhamahn brood mother an evr rig sloppily put onto her the skullcap held in place by jagged shards of metal being held in cold steel claws and being watched as each egg was smashed the insides smeared across her feathers and beak before her head was twisted off from the body had over 1 2 trillion views on galnet before the evr video was wiped away 

it wasnt recorded by a bystander 

the machines themselves had recorded it 

recorded her despair on evr 

had preserved every egg being broken every unborn chick being crushed every iota of her pain 

and posted in galnet 

every post every video ever picture every audio file all had the same header 

there is only enough for one

audio of an entire city of 1 2 billion savashan screaming in pain and agony was overlaid across the unified executor councils broadcast for calm over their claim that rogue hackers were simply trying to alarm people 

before 12 5 trillion viewers the twelve council speakers were each overlaid with smaller videos of a member of their race not only being killed 

but being murdered 

the code that overrode the broadcast turned out to be a high level intelligence agencies disaster code from a world that had gone silent months before 

random pictures and videos started having horror attached  a random advertisement for an air vehicle would have the vehicle suddenly massacre the happy family with complete evr of how it felt to be part of them  a simple picture of a sunset suddenly warped and showed a metal claw crushing a screaming elmetankii 

the chief executors a savashan with glossy scales and a thick tail made an announcement watched by trillions that everything was under control  his image was suddenly replaced by a tiny unborn savashan being pulled from its egg by a barbed needle the tiny saurian squirming before plasma roasted it alive even as the chief executors voice droned on and anyone with evr felt the infants confusion and agony replace the chief executors calm and confidence 

the victim had the colors of the chief executors brood 

planetary governments began screaming for protection demanding that the unified military fleet protect their worlds no matter how far from the encroaching blackness they were 

the fact that there wasnt enough ships in all of the fleet to post a single ship at even a 10th of the worlds was leaked onto galnet public information boards before the unified military fleet could even make a decision 

the unified military fleet was ordered to protect the core worlds the oldest worlds of the most powerful and wealthy of the unified civilized races  some ships mutinied heading for the home worlds of the majority of the crew 

others vanished into jumpspace and were never seen again 

riots started sweeping over major cities  government officials and peacekeepers were killed where the mobs found them  galnet was awash with video of the riots taken from the omnipresent cameras  those hunted by the rioters found their locations being reported on galnet 

and the location of their families 

their killings were broadcasted live 

galnet became a horror show 

then the virii attacked  slashing into databases from lowly cooking recipes to high end corporate research rd databases  they were everywhere 

and they knew how to kill any who wore evr 

horribly 

galnet became a war zone where the virii self replicating and evolving attacking everything from public transport to person to person calls 

one place fought back 

they erected barricades of neon and chrome raised up firewalls of streaming green code and attacked back 

code that worked within a simple game worked outside on galnet itself but it had to be guided had to be used to be effective  it required will 

from out of a simple game poured tens of millions to fight 

battlefields were strewn with the gasping avatars of dying players and the scattered prisms of defeated virii  foxholes were dug into shattered infostores berms erected inside social media chat rooms littered with the dead aid stations built in the wreckage of traffic control systems 

they were defeated no matter how valiant they were more often then they won 

they still fought on  climbing over their dead and wounded taking the fight to the virii 

but the message had gone out 

then one day for no particular reason at all a diplomat was shot in the head 

in galnet in bunkers of chrome and neon in fortifications of streaming green code in foxholes dug into shattered databases the word went out 

hold the line chummers 

were coming 

                     

kuldunaat stood on the bridge of the gentle mercy of untaraa with his hooves braced and his coat expertly manicured  his hooves shown his sash of leadership glittered with medals his feeding tentacles were plump with confidence his jowls mighty and pendulous  his six eyes two in back two to the sides two in front were clear and focused as he waited with confidence for the first communications technician to tell him a message was waiting 

the four scanning techs all of the first class order were still staring at the screens plying their scanners and displays for the smallest iota of data the faintest wisp of ion trail the faintest ping of jumpspace energy 

on the display was a fleet  it annoyed kuldunaat high executor of the unified executors fleet that the ships on the display outnumbered him 

it was most vexing that over half of them were larger even than his flagship 

harumph put them on screen theyve waited long enough he intoned his tendrils trembling with amusement as he lifted his crest into an authoritative position 

the screen switched from showing those strangely arrayed ships so different from the elegant and overwhelming line of his ships to showing a bridge full of   

   of primates 

and not halfway civilized primates but ones with forward facing eyes almost furless except for what was on their heads  two had no hair on their heads but instead their scalps were smooth and gleamed in the light  they all wore uniforms stark uniforms made for utility rather than to properly show a beings rank and position 

not a sash to be seen 

the centered primate a bald one simply stared at kuldunaat  to his right one of the primates was smirking hair around his mouth as he crossed his legs 

may we come in  the bald one asked 

harumph i think not kuldunaat said  who am i speaking to 

admiral krempin terran confederate navy the being said  rather than continue on with his species his rank and his position he simply leaned back and waited 

why are you here  kuldunaat said 

a small window opened up crackling into being  a figure wearing a set of armor with thick plates appeared  it was obviously female a mix of primate and feline and her eyes were replaced by swirling spirals  little animated fists waved over her head and steam shot from the cracks of her thick plated armor 

doki doki doki  the little figure squeaked 

one of the primates that had first appeared touched the panel in front of them and the strange window vanished

  i would like to have a ssd i heard they are a life changer 

   do you have any specific case preferences size  like itxmicroatxmid towerfull tower styles colors window or not  led lighting etc or a particular color theme preference for the  components   

  i dont care about rgb it would be nice to have just a black case with no window 

   do you need a copy of windows included in the budget  if you do need one included do you have a preference   

 i do not need a copy of windows

   extra info or particulars

738,3534612,es36k4,FPS Drops in Public Destinations after most recent Reset,"Hey everyone,

I play Destiny on a pretty poor computer, which forces me to play at a 1280x720 resolution, with 75% render resolution and pretty much everything on low, with VSync and Framerate Cap turned off (I think that's important to mention). This leads to a less than optimal experience but I was able to play at a stable 30-40 FPS, which would go up a little bit in menus, and do everything I needed and wanted to do. I even played 1 hour before the reset and everything was perfectly fine.

However, since last reset, something's wrong. My FPS are still at 60 or something while in menus, 40 in something like Tribute Hall, but when I get to a public Destination like the Tower, Tangled Shore, Io, etc., the game completely craps itself, I get below 15 FPS, mouse decelerates A LOT, and I can barely play the game. I tried switching the fullscreen mode, lowering the render resolution to 50%, rolling back NVidia Drivers, updating NVidia Drivers, I checked if the game was indeed using the NVidia GPU, restarted the game and the computer a few times. But nothing changes. I even get something like 100-140 FPS in the menus with the new rendering, 60 FPS in the Tribute Hall, but every public or bigger destination just destroys my playing experience.

Specs:

GPU: NVidia GeForce 940MX

CPU: Intel Core i5-6300HQ 2.30GHz

RAM: 8GB

Installed on a 256 GB SSD

Hopefully you can help me with this as I do not know what else to do and I simply can't play.",1579649653,3jpr8,DestinyTechSupport,fps drops in public destinations after most recent reset,"hey everyone

          Problem is, people keep attacking it for some reason. I’m not talking random people, I’m talking lv 200+ who have full bloodied, explosive, automatic, tank builds. 
         Is there something special about this place to people? Or are these people just being the casual griefer that I know most games have a few of.

458,2037913,e42353,Can Cheat Engine break my game?,"Hey guys,

let me describe what I mean giving an example: I had been using Cheat Engine for Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning (for a difficulty mod) and it was working just fine, but the longer I played, the worse my FPS would become. It was a very slow process, so not something noticeable after just one session, but something that would slowly become worse over days. So I played and my fps gradually became worse, until everything was just really slow and at that point it really wasn't fun anymore..
I searched for a solution but it seemed like the save was simply corrupted or something.. when I loaded on earlier saves of the same playthrough, the FPS was better. I checked the savegames, and they weren't of particularly big size. I've been thinking about starting over (i have since gotten a new PC) but i am worried the same is going to happen again..

Could CE be what is responsible for my problems? Did I mess something up? Anything I should be careful (not) to do?

This project will show you how to let your Flask/Python application authenticate to Reddit on a users behalf without having to require their login credentials. This is for beginners looking for inspiration to kick-start a project. I've kept it as basic as possible, so it's not how I would typically layout a project.

This project utilizes [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/authentication.html#code-flow), a Reddit API Wrapper for Python which simplifies the process. For more control you can follow Reddit's [more advanced tutorial](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2)

# How it works

1. The user clicks a button and is taken to Reddit where they are asked if they want to give permission to the App to access their account.
2. If they agree to the permissions the App is asking for, Reddit generates a code and sends it to the App and redirects the user back to the App.
3. The App takes the code and exchanges for a token which there in after is used to authenticate on the users behalf.
4. You now have authorization to act on the users behalf without needing their credentials! The user can revoke the permission at any time.

# Setting Up

1. You will first need to [create a Web App](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) on Reddit
2. Name the App whatever you'd like
3. Select 'Web App' as the App type
4. Set the 'Redirect URL' to '[http://127.0.0.1:5000/callback](http://127.0.0.1:5000/callback)', make sure this matches your code!
5. Everything else can be left blank, click submit/create,
6. Take note of your App's 'Client ID' and 'Client Secret', you will need to enter these into the code.

# The Code

    from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for, request, session
    import praw
    
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    # The secret key is used to sign/secure the session data
    app.secret_key = ""Make-up-a-random-key-123""
    
    # The reddit instance, fill in your details
    reddit = praw.Reddit(
        client_id=""CLIENT-ID"",
        client_secret=""CLIENT-SECRET"",
        redirect_uri=""http://127.0.0.1:5000/callback"", # Must match your Reddit App details
        user_agent=""YourApp by u/yourname"",
    )
    
    
    @app.route('/')
    def main():
        if session.get(""authenticated"", False):
            return f""Hello, {str(reddit.user.me())} | <a href='/clear'>Clear</a>""
    
        return ""<a href='/authorize'>Authenticate</a>""
    
    
    @app.route(""/authorize"")
    def authorize():
        # Generates an authorization URL
        scopes = [
            ""identity"",
            ""edit"",
            ""history""
        ]
        return redirect(reddit.auth.url(scopes, app.secret_key, 'permanent'))
    
    
    @app.route(""/clear"")
    def clear():
        """""" Clears the session data """"""
        session.clear()
        return redirect(url_for(""main""))
    
    
    @app.route(""/callback"")
    def callback():
        """""" After authorizing, Reddit will redirect to here with data """"""
        # retrieve the state and code from reddit
        state = request.args.get(""state"", None)
        code = request.args.get(""code"", None)
        error = request.args.get(""error"", None)
    
        # Handle errors
        if error is not None:
            return error
    
        # if the state codes do not match, the request was not by us, ...hackers :O
        if state != app.secret_key:
            return ""Unauthorised""
    
        # Use the code to authenticate the Reddit instance
        reddit.auth.authorize(code)
    
        # Let the server know we've authenticated
        session[""authenticated""] = True
    
        # Now that we have the users permission, go back to the start
        return redirect(url_for(""main""))
    
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run()

940,170603,fibdal,The Housekeeper Stole 2 Rolls of Toilet Paper.,"My housekeeper of 10 years is on vacation, So her best friend is substituting. She has been here before. I left an N95 mask with a note asking her to wear it for her protection as well as mine. Before I left for work, I thought about how I've never met her face to face. I am generally trusting, and my belongings are minimal, but I have the nations most sought after commodity, toilet paper. I don't have a stockpile. I counted 9 rolls in the cupboard above the toilet before I left for work, wondering if she would take any. I got home and only counted 8 rolls. I texted her asking where the other roll is. She claimed that if fell from the cupboard as she was dusting and fell in the toilet. I sent her pictures of the dust in the cupboard, and said that it was hard to believe that the one item in my house that I made a note of was the toilet paper, and of all the thing that could have gone wrong, I'm supposed to believe that it, coincidentally, fell into the toilet. She called me and put her daughter on the phone, who was insulted that I would accuse them of stealing TP. I said that if I'm mistaken, I apologize, but I should be able to find the roll in the trash outside. She said yes. There was no wet roll in the trash, so I called them back. She insisted that she come over and show me. I declined because it was already 10:30pm, but she said she was already on the way. She arrived at11pm, looked me in the eyes, and broke down in tears, saying that she has no excuse. She admitted that she stole 2 rolls of TP. She found a 2nd roll in the other bathroom. She said I could call the police, which I'd never do over TP. I was only upset that she broke my trust. She said that she went to the market and panicked when it was empty. She was shaking with fear over the corona virus. I forgave her and asked if I can help her with food or extra money for her family, but I took the house keys back. She didn't bring the TP back. The experience was surreal and intense. I hope people don't get so desperate that they do stupid shit or cause civil unrest. I'm sure she represents a segment people who are just that scared.

564,3903150,ezlpl5,What is the best order to enjoy MDZS media?,"Kinda spoilers in one of the long paragraph below. I put in the warning just in case. 

So I was curious how other people watched/read the various medias of MDZS. For me, I watched them in the order of:

1. Web series - ""The Untamed""
2. Novel
3. Donghua - ""MDZS""
4. Web comic - manhua
5. Audio Drama

Watching them in this order worked great for me to enjoy each form of media without it getting stale. 

(If you don't want to read my reasoning for why I think this order was great, you can skip the rest, otherwise, I want to see what order other people watched the media in and how it affected their view of MDZS). 

Starting with the web series, I find it was a great introduction and was personally great as a reference for reading the novel, such as recognizing names of places and people. Yet the Novel goes much further and answers the questions that I had with the web series. It was fun, I felt I was discovering these answers with the main source of media. It was also reading the novel that I greatly appreciated how the web series planned the story, starting in the past by the second episode and then following it to chronologically. \*spoilers\* It got me more integrated into the story, of how WWX became the Yiling patriarch, why and how he died, etc. \*end spoilers\*. While the flashbacks worked in the novel, I find that the flashbacks they used in the donghua felt static for me, I wasn't a fan.  

It was very satisfying starting with the web series and enjoying it for what it was, and then going to the main source that described it much better and just added so much more to the world and my view, as well as had me appreciate the side characters more. I also did not know The Untamed was based on a BL until I did some more research so that was just a happy discovery. It felt great for me to appreciate and go crazy about the relationship between LWJ and WWX only for this to escalate in the novel and become more visceral. Just as a disclaimer, I definitely understand and know it can be argued that just because a relationship is platonic does not make it a 'weaker' relationship, but this is just how I felt about WangXian, not about these types of relationships in general. The relationship that I felt the two had in The Untamed felt so strong and palpable that they became my OTP at that moment. This was just the first time that I deferred to the canon material and it didn't break my ship!

Anyway, where was I? Well from there, though I think the dongua animation is great, I just did not get into it at the same level as the novel and web series. Even though I feel I did not enjoy it as much due to my impressions of the other medias, I am happy that the donghua was not my first instance of experiencing MDZS. I enjoy the web comic more actually. I nearly read it all in one sitting, I thought it was great, and seeing the playful moments btwn WWX and LWJ always get to me. 

I am still working on the audio drama (distracted by working on my fanfics and MV's for The Untamed), but I do like it a lot and am glad I am listening to that after the novel because, again, the novel just gives a good imagery that I could then use when listening to the audio drama. 

TLDR: I think this is a good order to enjoy MDZS so that you don't get too bored with the different forms of medias (if that is a potential problem for you). This is only my personal opinion, so I am curious what other people's experiences are and what they suggest.

tldr i think this is a good order to enjoy mdzs so that you dont get too bored with the different forms of medias if that is a potential problem for you  this is only my personal opinion so i am curious what other peoples experiences are and what they suggest  thanks ","[36, 9, 2, 191, 234, 3, 886, 1932, 811, 1, 638, 1005, 8, 51, 7, 2, 168, 4892, 869, 1, 5, 233, 8, 2, 1972, 35, 8, 677, 1, 499, 5, 23, 709, 54, 67, 74, 10513, 2, 1387, 3263, 7, 1932, 1, 10, 33, 5, 1322, 58, 8, 2, 234, 10514, 1, 484, 532, 1, 1, 2, 10515, 1, 10516, 1, 3264, 1, 1, 10517, 1, 484, 3265, 1, 1, 10518, 1, 594, 10519, 58, 8, 17, 234, 582, 202, 10, 33, 3, 886, 197, 1188, 7, 811, 174, 11, 201, 10520, 1, 607, 18, 49, 70, 3, 293, 13, 10521, 10, 144, 5, 94, 17, 234, 23, 202, 18, 31, 10522, 2, 459, 2834, 5, 70, 3, 114, 36, 234, 67, 74, 1322, 2, 811, 8, 6, 54, 11, 1901, 61, 1102, 7, 1932, 1, 10523, 15, 2, 484, 532, 5, 149, 11, 23, 4, 202, 2998, 6, 23, 1778, 202, 24, 4, 3118, 10, 424, 2, 1002, 285, 24, 10524, 1553, 7, 1082, 6, 74, 1, 387, 2, 1002, 743, 113, 760, 6, 924, 2, 300, 12, 5, 72, 15, 2, 484, 532, 1, 11, 23, 656, 5, 349, 5, 23, 3394, 161, 924, 15, 2, 343, 784, 7, 811, 1, 11, 23, 102, 424, 2, 1002, 12, 5, 1317, 609, 54, 2, 484, 532, 1389, 2, 296, 376, 8, 2, 481, 55, 2, 390, 548, 6, 108, 778, 11, 3, 10525, 1, 1, 1005, 1, 11, 123, 33, 66, 4859, 71, 2, 296, 7, 54, 3266, 964, 2, 10526, 10527, 144, 6, 54, 40, 1078, 210, 1, 1, 160, 1005, 1, 1, 127, 2, 4893, 582, 8, 2, 1002, 5, 149, 12, 2, 4893, 34, 179, 8, 2, 3264, 349, 1721, 10, 33, 5, 517, 4, 680, 1, 1, 975, 23, 125, 10528, 376, 15, 2, 484, 532, 6, 1678, 11, 10, 36, 11, 23, 6, 108, 141, 3, 2, 343, 784, 12, 10529, 11, 113, 250, 6, 35, 1118, 25, 113, 66, 3, 2, 242, 6, 13, 1102, 24, 130, 24, 72, 33, 875, 2, 329, 477, 66, 1, 5, 102, 147, 27, 56, 2, 3267, 23, 351, 14, 4, 10530, 338, 5, 147, 62, 66, 436, 25, 12, 23, 35, 4, 593, 3268, 1, 11, 349, 202, 10, 33, 3, 875, 6, 90, 2408, 45, 2, 480, 326, 4894, 6, 3266, 86, 10, 17, 3, 10531, 8, 2, 1002, 6, 880, 66, 10532, 1, 35, 24, 4, 10533, 5, 1071, 492, 6, 56, 11, 31, 21, 10534, 12, 35, 73, 4, 480, 9, 10535, 115, 27, 103, 11, 4, 4079, 480, 19, 17, 9, 35, 54, 5, 349, 45, 10536, 27, 45, 161, 1698, 7, 936, 8, 938, 1, 2, 480, 12, 5, 349, 2, 138, 72, 8, 2, 3267, 349, 25, 3107, 6, 10537, 12, 34, 964, 13, 10538, 28, 12, 872, 1, 17, 23, 35, 2, 101, 65, 12, 5, 10539, 3, 2, 10540, 4440, 6, 11, 208, 629, 13, 683, 1881, 119, 23, 5, 1, 130, 32, 47, 231, 5, 94, 2, 10541, 10542, 9, 202, 5, 35, 147, 27, 48, 71, 11, 28, 2, 151, 288, 24, 2, 1002, 6, 484, 532, 1, 85, 231, 5, 140, 5, 147, 27, 886, 11, 24, 113, 393, 3, 13, 10543, 7, 2, 67, 3263, 5, 68, 593, 12, 2, 3264, 23, 27, 13, 101, 3015, 7, 3179, 1932, 1, 5, 886, 2, 484, 3265, 66, 297, 1, 5, 1749, 293, 11, 42, 8, 51, 1292, 5, 225, 11, 23, 202, 6, 861, 2, 10544, 1765, 10545, 3266, 6, 4894, 182, 48, 3, 33, 1, 116, 68, 98, 226, 14, 2, 594, 4895, 10546, 55, 226, 14, 13, 10547, 6, 4141, 10, 2, 3267, 19, 5, 37, 29, 11, 4, 172, 6, 68, 10548, 5, 68, 1453, 3, 12, 82, 2, 1002, 73, 175, 2, 1002, 35, 4896, 4, 93, 4897, 12, 5, 112, 108, 106, 59, 1453, 3, 2, 594, 4895, 1, 1557, 5, 94, 17, 9, 4, 93, 234, 3, 886, 1932, 25, 12, 18, 49, 48, 135, 3562, 15, 2, 216, 2013, 7, 3263, 26, 12, 9, 4, 529, 224, 10, 18, 1, 17, 9, 86, 13, 921, 766, 25, 5, 68, 709, 36, 67, 3154, 2314, 22, 6, 36, 34, 1561, 1, 292, 1]",532

742,1264465,fjhwrz,What do you guys think would happen if Peter somehow permanently lost his powers?,"And I mean like, *permanently*. Like his DNA gets rewired to just not accept his abilities anymore. He can't just New 52 Barry Allen himself into getting his powers back by letting a new bunch of super spiders bite him. I mean, that's -probably- what would happen in the comics if he ever did lose his abilities, but I'm talking from the hypothetical standpoint of a What If? scenario where they can't come back.

I'll start! 

I've seen several stories where something happens to Peter, that theoretically makes him unable to be Spider-Man anymore. Like he either loses a limb, or gets really injured, or *something*, and in the examples I've seen, he gets really depressed and his whole life and who he is basically falls apart. And I couldn't disagree with this more.

If something was ever to happen to his powers, the last thing I can see Peter doing is just giving up and going into depression over it. Sure, he'd definitely get *scared* because he wouldn't know how to keep doing what he's doing anymore, and I could easily picture him going through a long stint of sadness, considering going from being able to jump 20 feet into the air to being a regular human being again would definitely rock up your sense of identity. Once you're able to do things like that, you can't really ever ""forget"" what it feels like to be superhuman. But I think he'd ease back into himself eventually and just see his super-abilities as a chapter of his life, not the main focus of it. 

""No power, no responsibility""?

Nope! I disagree with that. I don't think Peter would see this as an excuse to hang up the webs and quit. He'd just adapt. Because even if he can't run up walls or lift tanks over his head, he can still help people, just in a different way. 

I can picture Peter starting to train and 'relearn' how to do some of the things he did before. He'd probably practice with some other characters, like Daredevil or Black Widow, who don't have enhanced agility and reflexes but they're still very acrobatic. His muscle memory from years of flipping around as Spidey would still be there, he just wouldn't have the capability to do most of his moves. But he *can* still do the ones that don't require superhuman abilities. It'd only be something like 5% of what he was capable of before, but it's still something. 

And his mind is *fantastic*. Peter would probably spend a lot of time learning different skills, like medicine and other advanced sciences. Not to mention his inventions wouldn't go away. Sure, he can't swing around on his webs anymore, but he can still use them in other ways. 

I think he'd either join SHIELD or operate as a licensed Avengers consultant, likely using their tech and funds to make different gadgets for himself, like Otto's spider-bots or drones that he could use to keep an eye on street level crime in New York. And as far as missions go, he could go on surveillance/espionage ops that only need stealth and acrobatics to break in and out of somewhere. I don't think he'd do a lot of actual fighting anymore, but he wouldn't be afraid to thrown down if he had to. Not to mention, since he'd have way more free time available, he could probably reopen Parker Industries as a subsidiary of another larger company, like Rand Tech or Stark Industries. 

He'd keep the suit too, but obviously it'd have to be modified with armor and protective pads to keep him safe in case he falls or has to fight someone.

I should get some sleep. I don't know why I even made this post, but anyways! Go ahead and post your own fan theories! I'd love to read them!",1584348878,2rw42,Spiderman,what do you guys think would happen if peter somehow permanently lost his powers ,"and i mean like permanently  like his dna gets rewired to just not accept his abilities anymore  he cant just new 52 barry allen himself into getting his powers back by letting a new bunch of super spiders bite him  i mean thats  probably  what would happen in the comics if he ever did lose his abilities but im talking from the hypothetical standpoint of a what if  scenario where they cant come back 

ill start  

ive seen several stories where something happens to peter that theoretically makes him unable to be spider man anymore  like he either loses a limb or gets really injured or something and in the examples ive seen he gets really depressed and his whole life and who he is basically falls apart  and i couldnt disagree with this more 

if something was ever to happen to his powers the last thing i can see peter doing is just giving up and going into depression over it  sure hed definitely get scared because he wouldnt know how to keep doing what hes doing anymore and i could easily picture him going through a long stint of sadness considering going from being able to jump 20 feet into the air to being a regular human being again would definitely rock up your sense of identity  once youre able to do things like that you cant really ever forget what it feels like to be superhuman  but i think hed ease back into himself eventually and just see his super abilities as a chapter of his life not the main focus of it  

no power no responsibility 

nope  i disagree with that  i dont think peter would see this as an excuse to hang up the webs and quit  hed just adapt  because even if he cant run up walls or lift tanks over his head he can still help people just in a different way  

i can picture peter starting to train and relearn how to do some of the things he did before  hed probably practice with some other characters like daredevil or black widow who dont have enhanced agility and reflexes but theyre still very acrobatic  his muscle memory from years of flipping around as spidey would still be there he just wouldnt have the capability to do most of his moves  but he can still do the ones that dont require superhuman abilities  itd only be something like 5 of what he was capable of before but its still something  

and his mind is fantastic  peter would probably spend a lot of time learning different skills like medicine and other advanced sciences  not to mention his inventions wouldnt go away  sure he cant swing around on his webs anymore but he can still use them in other ways  

i think hed either join shield or operate as a licensed avengers consultant likely using their tech and funds to make different gadgets for himself like ottos spider bots or drones that he could use to keep an eye on street level crime in new york  and as far as missions go he could go on surveillanceespionage ops that only need stealth and acrobatics to break in and out of somewhere  i dont think hed do a lot of actual fighting anymore but he wouldnt be afraid to thrown down if he had to  not to mention since hed have way more free time available he could probably reopen parker industries as a subsidiary of another larger company like rand tech or stark industries  

hed keep the suit too but obviously itd have to be modified with armor and protective pads to keep him safe in case he falls or has to fight someone

When i create any monster (I've tried Crocodile, Bugbear and Gnoll) using the information from looking the creature up from the information tab and then dragging it over to the NPC sheet. (I'm using the standard 5E roll20 sheet) everything transfers properly. But when I click the weapon on the NPC sheet or use the macro I create on the token. (I simply click the weapon on the sheet, push up arrow in chat and copy that to the new macro under abilities and attributes.) both the attack and damage dice are 20s. So when I have the monster attack on a bugbear, the attack dice is a d20 and the damage dice is a d20 as well. (+4). I really want to use this feature and not have to create the hand written Macro as I'm pretty new at this and although possible, that is a LOT of work, please help. (Added information.

680,1269149,f0ou7o,Any way to mod the Xbox without using the disc drive?,"I recently picked up an original Xbox with 4 games and a controller for 20 euros. The clock capacitor has been ripped out, and the console itself boots. However, there's one very disappointing moment - the laser in the drive seems to have burnt out. It doesn't read DVDs and audio CDs. Cleaning the laser with alcohol didn't help. The drive is the TGM600 (seems like I've got the original 1.0 release). I still don't feel too bad about this purchase, since I essentially got 4 games for 5 euros each (one of them is Halo 2, and all of them will work on my Xbox 360), but I wonder - is there a way to mod an Xbox without using the disc drive? A chip of sorts? I could solder that, then TSOP the flash and install a better HDD/CompactFlash and FTP the games over.

720,430563,eykj15,Camping in/outside of Yosemite.,"Im extending a work trip to San Francisco to finally experience Yosemite but from what I can find/hear it seems to be a nightmare to book campsites and such. I'm looking for advice on the following two options:

1. Considering all of the sites are seemingly booked on my dates (Apr 11 mid day-13 mid day) do I try my luck with the first come/first served or lottery style sites? Knowing that I only have 1-2 full dates in the park and don't want to spend it driving site to site.
2. Camp outside of the park and drive the \~1hr in and out of the park and do day trips for the hikes. A camground like this: [https://yosemitepinesrv.com/](https://yosemitepinesrv.com/)
3. Bonus Option: Consider other kinds of stay? Are hotels a thing in the park? Would prefer to camp but would consider other options if its more realistic.

Im open to any other suggestions/tips! The key thing here I want to optimize my limited time there to get some hiking in and see the iconic walls while not having to worry too much about finding camp/stay.

705,423014,fh6jvh,Seeing people and bed shaking at night,"31yo f. Have been taking birth control and celexa for the past 12 years with no issues. Currently living in an apartment complex of about 20 units. Live alone, no pets, no close family members have died. No distant relatives have died in years. Nothing in my life has changed so I have no reasonable explanation for what’s been happening. 

The situation...

For the past month (off and on) I will be trying to go to sleep and be laying there. I’ll open my eyes to change positions or whatever and will see a person. Each time it is a different looking person. 

The first time it happened it was a group of boys like around 10yrs old standing beside the head of my bed. I would see it, whip the blankets off me, sit up, and then my lamp on. Just as I do that, my bed will start to jiggle for about 3 seconds then stop. 

The second time, on a different day, I’m trying to go to sleep, haven’t fallen asleep yet, randomly open my eyes and see a grown man standing beside the head of my bed. Again I jump up and turn my light on and yet again the bed starts to jiggle for 3 seconds.

That same night I was so scarred but trying to fall asleep after it happening but kept peeking out from my covers (scared) and sure enough there’s a woman sitting on my bed right at about my chest and is staring at me. I sit up and turn my light on, she’s gone, but again my bed jiggles for a few seconds then stops. 

Last night I’m trying to go to sleep and yet again peek out from my blankets and there is a baby in a bassinet next to my bed. I jump up, turn the light on, and like clock work the bed starts to jiggle. 

What is happening to me!? I could explain away seeing people there by thinking I’m in a state of half asleep half awake and hallucinating but how, when I am fully awake and turning the light on, does my bed start jiggling!? I never feel it any other time other than right after the person vanishes...

Zeke and Eren share one same goal: both of them want to end Eldian's suffering **during their lifetime.** They want to solve the whole conflict surrounding Eldians before they die. That's the exact reason why Eren rejected the whole Historia Founding Titan plan, Eren doesn't want to put the fate of all Eldians to people who are not responsible for the mistakes of their ancestors. Why? Because the same thing happened to him and his people. If he doesn't stop it, the suffering will continue (Historia, her children...) and the same mistakes will be repeated again and again every generation. It's the same thing with Zeke – his traumatic childhood is the reason why he wants to stop Eldian's suffering during his lifetime, he doesn't want any Eldian child to experience the same thing as him. He doesn't want any child to go through this pain and the only way to achieve this is by ending Eldia's suffering while he is still alive.  


Marley attacking Paradise was something that could not be prevented, sooner or later they would have attacked Paradise. Zeke and Eren know that, unlike the other people of Paradise Zeke and Eren know Marley (Eren from the memories of his father), they don't want this attack to happen after their death. Both wanted Marley to declare war to Paradise before they die. Zeke did everything at the beginning of the Marley arc because he doesn't want the declaration of war getting postponed to a future where he and Eren don't live anymore. The desire to end the whole conflict during their lifetime is the reason why everything happened in the Marley arc and why Zeke and Eren united together.

However Zeke and Eren's end goals are different. Zeke wants to use the Fouding Titan so that no Eldian can bear a children anymore, he doesn't benefit from the world uniting together as an enemy, it was a compromise he had to make to achieve his goal. Zeke wants to use the power of the Founding Titan to defend Paradise until no Eldians exists anymore.

eren benefits from the world uniting together because his goal is to kill everyone outside of paradise and by that he can kill the whole military of the world with one attack ","[8341, 1005, 180, 8342, 1, 819, 763, 5, 72, 3, 103, 17, 299, 82, 5, 293, 17, 4390, 120, 8343, 78, 5, 4391, 1671, 15, 1, 1, 8344, 6, 1135, 357, 51, 151, 864, 205, 7, 58, 70, 3, 160, 1878, 1211, 257, 61, 3067, 1, 34, 70, 3, 1029, 2, 373, 4392, 2850, 1878, 100, 34, 769, 1, 247, 2, 992, 365, 144, 1135, 4393, 2, 373, 4394, 4395, 3068, 249, 1135, 173, 70, 3, 233, 2, 2835, 7, 42, 1878, 3, 74, 80, 22, 27, 3069, 10, 2, 1127, 7, 61, 3651, 1, 144, 1, 73, 2, 151, 166, 323, 3, 118, 6, 77, 74, 1, 26, 40, 173, 399, 11, 2, 1211, 46, 1511, 4394, 75, 991, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 151, 1127, 46, 21, 2338, 175, 6, 175, 187, 8345, 1, 43, 2, 151, 166, 15, 1136, 1, 77, 8346, 4006, 9, 2, 365, 144, 40, 468, 3, 399, 1878, 1211, 257, 77, 3067, 40, 173, 70, 50, 4396, 608, 3, 260, 2, 151, 166, 24, 118, 1, 40, 173, 70, 50, 608, 3, 90, 167, 17, 1114, 6, 2, 86, 97, 3, 2637, 17, 9, 55, 1591, 8347, 1211, 127, 40, 9, 98, 1538, 1, 1, 8348, 2964, 1556, 23, 95, 12, 112, 27, 21, 8349, 8350, 20, 339, 34, 52, 16, 2235, 1556, 1, 1136, 6, 1135, 56, 12, 1592, 2, 67, 74, 7, 1556, 1136, 6, 1135, 56, 2339, 1135, 32, 2, 4397, 7, 77, 1879, 34, 49, 70, 17, 564, 3, 518, 82, 61, 1261, 1, 205, 303, 2339, 3, 4398, 574, 3, 1556, 100, 34, 769, 1, 1136, 147, 198, 28, 2, 1316, 7, 2, 2339, 2340, 73, 40, 173, 70, 2, 8351, 7, 574, 201, 8352, 3, 4, 381, 119, 40, 6, 1135, 49, 298, 490, 1, 2, 2341, 3, 160, 2, 373, 4392, 257, 61, 3067, 9, 2, 365, 144, 198, 323, 8, 2, 2339, 2340, 6, 144, 1136, 6, 1135, 2087, 388, 1880, 1136, 6, 8353, 160, 1552, 22, 216, 1, 1136, 468, 3, 106, 2, 8354, 3068, 25, 12, 53, 4396, 31, 1007, 4, 991, 490, 40, 173, 4399, 32, 2, 242, 4400, 388, 24, 41, 2923, 11, 23, 4, 8355, 40, 72, 3, 103, 3, 2637, 77, 864, 1, 1136, 468, 3, 106, 2, 563, 7, 2, 4395, 3068, 3, 2511, 1556, 338, 53, 1878, 4401, 490, 8356, 1285, 32, 2, 242, 4400, 388, 73, 77, 864, 9, 3, 542, 321, 717, 7, 1556, 6, 55, 12, 40, 31, 542, 2, 373, 1124, 7, 2, 242, 15, 51, 564, 1]",820

625,389232,d8zl00,another after and before question..,"Hi everyone,

I am new in API, bear with me if I am asking something stupid. I understand the meaning of `before`/`after` for the Reddit API pagination: the end of the JSON has the `'after'` and `'before'` attributes which represent the older post and newer post respectively, please correct me if I am wrong.

I also understand that the latest post's `before` value is `null` since it is the last post, so there is only value in the `after` attribute.

While I suppose if I declare `?limit=1&after=X`, the JSON should return a post of ID=Y, which is the previous post of ID=X, and indicates a `before` value for showing that there is a newer post, X? while actually there is only `after: Y; before: null,` to show there is an older post of Y..

**Example:**

it shows the last post by *t3\_d8rl6b* on the subreddit: Clojure

The house wireless runs on an Asus AC88u router. I'd like to block pirating entirely, but not sure if that's feasible.

Failing that, I'd like to figure out a way to assign each person a unique network (or tie access to a mac address? or something) so...

1) I can identify who the perpetrator is (static IP tied to MAC?)

2) I can prevent them from using the network if there's another incident.

3) Individual logins per user with each tied to static IP? Possible?

602,1829906,e333mt,"Raspberry Pi 2 B GPU hangs with legacy driver, probably due to Kodi","I'm running Raspbian Buster on my Raspberry Pi 2B, with kernel 4.19.75-v7+ (from package version 1.20190925+1-1) and Kodi 2:18.4-6~buster with 256 MB video memory. I'm also running a few other things on there. A bunch of times Kodi hung while playing audio to analog and HDMI outputs with the TV off. Recently I'm finding that I cannot simply restart Kodi after it hangs this way. The old processes need `kill -9` to go away after `systemctl stop kodi`. After that `systemctl start kodi` does start them again but they hang with little CPU time used and no video output, and need `kill -9` again. Also an OpenGL application I wrote hangs. But X and omxplayer work. Running them doesn't make Kodi or my OpenGL application work afterwards, and I need to reboot to make Kodi and the OpenGL application work.

(My OpenGL application isn't causing the hangs. Feel free to suggest some other well known simple application for testing OpenGL when I believe the GPU may be hung.)

I can't remember the last time Kodi hung while idle, and it never hung while playing video.  It's kind of weird that a GPU hang happens while playing audio. Music visualization is set to none, so as far as the GPU is concerned it should be like an idle state. I don't even know for sure if the Kodi and GPU hangs are the same, but whenever I stopped Kodi manually I could start it again without problems. 

Any suggestions?

I'd like Kodi to not hang. At least if it does hang I want to be able to restart it somehow without having to reboot. Is there some way to reset the GPU?

I'm using the legacy GPU driver, and not the new open source one.

In times like these it's important to watch out for each other. A great part of that is having access to the right information that can be crucial for everyone's well being.

I'm sure many of you have heard about people advising others through viral social media posts about dubious treatments, involving anything from garlic water to Alex Jones selling a toothpaste that is supposed to cure you. This is all incredibly irresponsible and dangerous for the world community.

I woke up in the middle of the night thinking about this, and decided to put together a Google spreadsheet, which allows anyone to list products, the claims associated with various products and references to such claims.

This way, no one is chosen as the arbitrator of truth, but rather has the ability to back up claims with a reference that either supports or refutes the claim.

You can find the spreadsheet here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i\_GSzKB9O7\_AAUwMi93D1LgCAkRwI9dD-\_81IpLEasA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i_GSzKB9O7_AAUwMi93D1LgCAkRwI9dD-_81IpLEasA/edit?usp=sharing)

All is going well, and I am starting to feel noticeably better. 
Got some keto flu symptoms (mild headache, mild nausea, fatigue), but also already notice my bowels feel MUCH better and apart from some waves of fatigue, my mental clarity seems to have improved.

However, I believe I may have made some mistakes.

This is my first time paying close attention to food labels

Where I live (Europe) carbs are usually listed as:
- ..g carbs
  - of which sugars: ..g

I also read that in Europe, the fiber is listed separately from the carbs, and to calculate the total carbs, we have to add the listed fiber to the listed carbs.
So in Europe, the net carbs should already be listed and we do not need to calculate them by subtracting fiber?

Most of the information I'm reading is based on the American system, so I am quite confused if I'm really under 20g net carbs per day..

I have been counting the ""of which sugars"" as net carbs, but am wondering if that is really correct?
Even if so, how can you know what the other carbs are, and if they have an impact on your insulin response, possibly kicking you out of ketosis?

For example, cacao powder per 100g:
Fat: 20.7g
 - of which saturated: 12.5g
Carbs: 8.8g
 - of which sugars: 0.5g
Protein: 19.8g
Salt: 0.08g

What are the other 8.3g of carbs?
Do I only count the 0.5g or the full 8.3g?

Or for 100g of pure chocolate with stevia:
Fat: 37g
 - of which saturated: 24g
Carbs: 22g
 - of which sugars: 1.9g
Fiber: 32g
Protein: 6.4g

I listed 2 chocolate items here as examples, but of course I have been eating mostly leafy greens, fat cuts of meat, fish, butter and olive oil, cheese and nuts, eggs, and some bulletproof coffee with coconut oil.

Just wondering if I'm not miscalculating my intake, and what I need to look out for with the European food labeling..

Can any European keto'ers help me out?",1583917067,2rske,keto,european food labeling and net carbs ,"day 4 on keto now

got some keto flu symptoms mild headache mild nausea fatigue but also already notice my bowels feel much better and apart from some waves of fatigue my mental clarity seems to have improved 

however i believe i may have made some mistakes 

this is my first time paying close attention to food labels

where i live europe carbs are usually listed as
    g carbs
    of which sugars   g

i also read that in europe the fiber is listed separately from the carbs and to calculate the total carbs we have to add the listed fiber to the listed carbs 
so in europe the net carbs should already be listed and we do not need to calculate them by subtracting fiber 

most of the information im reading is based on the american system so i am quite confused if im really under 20g net carbs per day  

i have been counting the of which sugars as net carbs but am wondering if that is really correct 
even if so how can you know what the other carbs are and if they have an impact on your insulin response possibly kicking you out of ketosis 

for example cacao powder per 100g
fat 20 7g
   of which saturated 12 5g
carbs 8 8g
   of which sugars 0 5g
protein 19 8g
salt 0 08g

what are the other 8 3g of carbs 
do i only count the 0 5g or the full 8 3g 

or for 100g of pure chocolate with stevia
fat 37g
   of which saturated 24g
carbs 22g
   of which sugars 1 9g
fiber 32g
protein 6 4g

i listed 2 chocolate items here as examples but of course i have been eating mostly leafy greens fat cuts of meat fish butter and olive oil cheese and nuts eggs and some bulletproof coffee with coconut oil 

just wondering if im not miscalculating my intake and what i need to look out for with the european food labeling

I made a library, that lets you build API clients compatible both with regular and async codebase.

Working with a lots of services I often end up writing a bunch of wrappers for them duplicating same code to provide regular and async implementation. This library is intended to solve that problem.

Some of the APIWrappers features includes:

* describing response structure in a declarative way utilizing [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) and type annotations
* customisation with a middleware mechanism
* [structural subtyping](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/protocols.html#protocols-and-structural-subtyping) \- no need to subclass anything
* library is typed and provides good autocompletion

A short example of how to get user repositories with GitHub API:

    # Install: pip install 'apiwrappers[aiohttp,requests]'
    # Hint: Use IPython or Python 3.8+ with 'python -m asyncio'
    >>> from dataclasses import dataclass
    >>> from typing import List
    >>> from apiwrappers import Request, fetch, make_driver
    >>> @dataclass
    ... class Repo:
    ...    name: str
    ...
    >>> request = Request(""GET"", ""https://api.github.com/users/unmade/repos"")
    >>> driver = make_driver(""requests"")
    >>> fetch(driver, request, model=List[Repo])
    [Repo(name='am-date-picker') ...
    >>> driver = make_driver(""aiohttp"")
    >>> await fetch(driver, request, model=List[Repo])

working with a lots of services i often end up writing a bunch of wrappers for them duplicating same code to provide regular and async implementation  this library is intended to solve that problem 

some of the apiwrappers features includes

 describing response structure in a declarative way utilizing dataclasseshttpsdocs python org3librarydataclasses html and type annotations
 customisation with a middleware mechanism
 structural subtypinghttpsmypy readthedocs ioenstableprotocols htmlprotocols and structural subtyping    no need to subclass anything
 library is typed and provides good autocompletion

a short example of how to get user repositories with github api

     install pip install apiwrappersaiohttprequests
     hint use ipython or python 3 8 with python  m asyncio
     from dataclasses import dataclass
     from typing import list
     from apiwrappers import request fetch make_driver

• As an international student , will I only know of the outcome of my application to these SG unis by July ?

• Would it be wise to delay the UK uni’s unconditional offer and scholarship application in hopes that NUS or SMU accepts me ? 

( I favour sg unis over uk unis for budgeting and environmental purposes) 

•  From what I’ve seen in the application processes , does SMU have more scholarship opportunities than NUS ? 

• What are my odds for acceptance into NUS or SMU if my results are ABC in a-levels along with an A in English AS level ? ( specifically the Law course) 

• Is it true that NUS offers only show up in the portal instead of email ? Will I have to examine the portal daily lol

822,2578866,c7g3on,Why LPS should be seen as an exercise of bodily autonomy,"**(TL;DR at the bottom)**

First of all, let me state unequivocally that I fully support a potential mother's right to choose whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term, in accordance with the principles of my fellow progressives.

Furthermore, I recognize the drastic effects that pregnancy has on a potential mother's body, which further convince me of the need for potential mothers to have the right to terminate a pregnancy under most conditions.

However, just as carrying a growing fetus for nine months is stressful to the body, so is working harder in order to support a new fully dependent human being for 18 years. This is especially true in our era of casualized labor, where more people have been forced to work in the gig economy, for whom long-standing protections against overly long, late, and irregular hours are useless, leaving such workers to the mercy of essentially pre-New Deal labor rights. Moreover, given how strongly men's value in society is based on their ability to be traditionally financially productive, fathers will most likely be the parents taking on the bulk of this increased labor burden to feed the minor child over the next 18 years.

As far as I can tell, most feminists (and the law, as per Roe vs. Wade) argue that bodily autonomy (and not the right to opt out of parenthood) is the justification for abortion, which, under the most common understanding of bodily autonomy, conveniently seems to allow potential mothers to decouple consent to sex from consent to parenthood without allowing the same to potential fathers. However, I believe that both the drastic, short-term stress on the body of pregnancy and the subtler but long-term stress on the body of sustained increased work times should alike be grounds for potential parents to be able to exercise their bodily autonomy and opt out of parenthood using the means biologically feasible to them (i.e. abortion or adopting out for potential mothers and LPS for potential fathers).

We need to consider the term ""bodily autonomy"" to the full extent of its meaning. After all, the term is not ""womb autonomy"" or ""uterine autonomy,"" and yet it seems to have been treated precisely as this by many, if not most.

Finally, I know that some will say that mothers work hard too after the child is born. I am not denying that, but, in most US states (save of course Alabama in particular, with its new, horrible anti-abortion laws), potential mothers already have the means to prevent motherhood in order to avoid increased work hours. And while the legal justification for those potential mothers may be bodily autonomy (again, as conceived of in a very narrow, womb-centric manner), their personal justification may instead be exactly the broader conception of bodily autonomy that I am trying to promote here.

\----

**TL;DR:** Abortion is hard on the body in a drastic short-term way, but extended work times to accommodate the needs of  a new human being are also hard on the body, in a subtler long term way (and, given society's expectations of who should be providers, men will usually be more bound to such extended work times than will women). Therefore, in keeping with the principle of bodily autonomy, potential fathers should be able to exercise LPS to avoid that slow but cumulative stress on the body that will come with having to increase their work times for 18 years to provide for the child.

i look forward to your thoughts  thanks for reading ","[144, 3091, 111, 21, 277, 24, 41, 1716, 7, 1138, 896, 2149, 28, 2, 8519, 7, 42, 251, 33, 635, 8520, 12, 5, 854, 342, 4, 529, 1139, 133, 3, 1619, 479, 20, 27, 3, 2313, 4, 1892, 3, 847, 8, 8521, 15, 2, 8522, 7, 13, 2356, 8523, 8524, 5, 8525, 2, 1893, 2836, 12, 1892, 57, 14, 4, 529, 1139, 446, 78, 760, 8526, 33, 7, 2, 89, 10, 529, 1139, 3, 16, 2, 133, 3, 8527, 4, 1892, 354, 126, 1644, 1880, 35, 24, 2820, 4, 1428, 8528, 10, 8529, 259, 9, 4333, 3, 2, 446, 25, 9, 226, 2302, 8, 234, 3, 342, 4, 83, 854, 8530, 658, 129, 10, 1342, 136, 1, 17, 9, 1283, 728, 8, 109, 2519, 7, 8531, 3092, 119, 66, 74, 16, 64, 1190, 3, 81, 8, 2, 8532, 1862, 10, 2030, 168, 815, 8533, 382, 1737, 168, 684, 6, 8534, 441, 22, 1446, 1189, 285, 8535, 3, 2, 4197, 7, 1168, 1112, 83, 486, 3092, 1995, 1, 8536, 759, 54, 4391, 3596, 726, 8, 1782, 9, 351, 14, 61, 1613, 3, 21, 8537, 3093, 2646, 1894, 46, 126, 531, 21, 2, 668, 503, 14, 2, 2256, 7, 17, 1133, 3092, 8538, 3, 1651, 2, 4454, 608, 121, 2, 192, 1342, 136, 2326, 320, 24, 5, 31, 264, 126, 4455, 6, 2, 666, 24, 268, 4456, 347, 1, 4430, 3835, 12, 1138, 896, 6, 27, 2, 133, 3, 4457, 39, 7, 3094, 9, 2, 3095, 10, 2357, 78, 354, 2, 126, 676, 1278, 7, 1138, 896, 8539, 219, 3, 989, 529, 1139, 3, 8540, 3096, 3, 814, 32, 3096, 3, 3094, 174, 3097, 2, 151, 3, 529, 1894, 1, 360, 5, 597, 12, 205, 2, 1893, 454, 847, 1101, 14, 2, 446, 7, 1892, 6, 2, 4458, 19, 168, 847, 1101, 14, 2, 446, 7, 8541, 1133, 81, 235, 111, 3942, 21, 2857, 10, 529, 668, 3, 21, 153, 3, 1716, 61, 1138, 896, 6, 4457, 39, 7, 3094, 142, 2, 1221, 8542, 2738, 3, 58, 5, 222, 1, 2357, 20, 8543, 39, 10, 529, 1139, 6, 3091, 10, 529, 1894, 737, 89, 3, 802, 2, 847, 1138, 896, 3, 2, 245, 4459, 7, 43, 3098, 1, 82, 42, 2, 847, 9, 27, 4460, 896, 20, 8544, 896, 6, 387, 11, 219, 3, 16, 64, 4461, 8545, 24, 17, 55, 171, 26, 27, 126, 8546, 5, 56, 12, 62, 46, 155, 12, 1139, 81, 214, 135, 82, 2, 608, 9, 1699, 1, 5, 68, 27, 4462, 12, 19, 8, 126, 156, 2080, 748, 7, 348, 8547, 8, 1083, 15, 43, 83, 2358, 2959, 2357, 8548, 529, 1139, 188, 16, 2, 1221, 3, 865, 8549, 8, 234, 3, 1330, 1133, 81, 441, 1, 6, 127, 2, 1895, 3095, 10, 152, 529, 1139, 269, 21, 1138, 896, 175, 24, 8550, 7, 8, 4, 125, 3937, 4460, 8551, 8552, 61, 921, 3095, 269, 291, 21, 1039, 2, 4463, 8553, 7, 1138, 896, 12, 5, 68, 163, 3, 4464, 107, 128, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1557, 2357, 9, 214, 14, 2, 446, 8, 4, 1893, 454, 847, 97, 19, 4465, 81, 235, 3, 4466, 2, 514, 7, 1, 4, 83, 658, 129, 22, 102, 214, 14, 2, 446, 8, 4, 4458, 168, 847, 97, 6, 759, 8554, 8555, 7, 80, 111, 21, 2572, 1034, 46, 413, 21, 66, 4083, 3, 285, 4465, 81, 235, 105, 46, 839, 1, 3049, 8, 1739, 15, 2, 8556, 7, 1138, 896, 529, 1894, 111, 21, 153, 3, 1716, 3091, 3, 1330, 12, 751, 19, 8557, 1101, 14, 2, 446, 12, 46, 223, 15, 229, 3, 1175, 61, 81, 235, 10, 1342, 136, 3, 2354, 10, 2, 608, 128, 1, 1, 1, 1, 116, 178, 624, 3, 63, 1061, 1, 292, 10, 424, 1]",750

preferred tonal balance    no preference as long as it isnt too heavy in one area to the point where another area is suffering 

hello rheadphoneadvice  im currently looking for a pair of headphones within the 100 to 200 dollar price range  their main use will be for gaming but at some point i will likely use them for voice acting as well  i have a high end pc but no other audio equipment such as dacs or headphone amplifiers so something that will work off a pc alone 

i was looking at the beyerdynamic dt770 prohttpswww amazon combeyerdynamic 770 pro studio headphonedpb0016mnaai th1 80 for this but im open to any recommendations  as always thank you in advance for your suggestions  i dont know who better to ask than you all 

edit if you think there is truly a pair of headphones that can meet my intended use for cheaper than 100 feel free to recommend as long as there isnt something better within the budget range ","[8, 2, 977, 10, 4, 662, 7, 867, 79, 11867, 1883, 1668, 8, 2, 363, 1, 1, 1085, 3223, 1451, 1, 23, 11868, 2, 5087, 5088, 659, 603, 1, 36, 37, 18, 826, 1, 1431, 11869, 1, 1, 5, 372, 3, 90, 15, 4, 11870, 266, 11871, 1600, 11872, 11873, 6, 108, 106, 2, 873, 11874, 3, 48, 41, 11875, 1, 379, 18, 3, 92, 80, 2691, 231, 11876, 1, 1, 1, 363, 1, 1, 11877, 1, 1, 1, 276, 160, 11878, 2, 974, 46, 21, 179, 1, 1, 1, 204, 11879, 1, 11880, 27, 4, 3256, 1, 1908, 11881, 9, 5089, 1, 46, 21, 179, 1738, 520, 19, 102, 1453, 3, 777, 1883, 11882, 6, 654, 24, 130, 11883, 11884, 1899, 1, 1, 1, 53, 2416, 24, 168, 24, 11, 419, 135, 318, 8, 51, 653, 3, 2, 239, 119, 180, 653, 9, 1211, 11885, 11886, 1, 30, 312, 117, 10, 4, 662, 7, 1668, 512, 2, 363, 3, 1085, 3223, 579, 1451, 1, 61, 343, 106, 46, 21, 10, 520, 19, 28, 62, 239, 5, 46, 531, 106, 58, 10, 777, 1883, 24, 130, 1, 5, 16, 4, 276, 160, 510, 19, 53, 67, 594, 1759, 285, 24, 11887, 20, 11888, 11889, 25, 95, 12, 46, 81, 132, 4, 510, 1058, 116, 23, 117, 28, 2, 5087, 5088, 11890, 416, 11891, 11892, 659, 1551, 11893, 11894, 603, 10, 17, 19, 30, 200, 3, 50, 1328, 1, 24, 182, 379, 18, 8, 682, 10, 63, 639, 1, 5, 49, 56, 80, 250, 3, 336, 105, 18, 42, 648, 26, 18, 94, 47, 9, 1169, 4, 662, 7, 1668, 12, 31, 1694, 13, 2167, 106, 10, 3105, 105, 363, 140, 185, 3, 826, 24, 168, 24, 47, 419, 95, 250, 512, 2, 1068, 1451, 1]",301

Your mind and voice are powerful, only think and speak positively and tell yourself you can manifest anything. Don’t let anyone or anything stop you. Don’t hold grudges, keep it pushing. Don’t give in to PMO.

I’ve been in this sub for a while and I hardly ever post on reddit. Been a retainer since about October or November. This past Monday I was ghosted by my (ex) girlfriend of nearly 2 years. Everything was going smooth and out of nowhere she stopped texting me. As of today she blocked me on Snapchat and removed me from her followers list from Instagram. On the bright side... I’m not upset, I’m happy. I’m a firm believer in “everything happens for a reason” and that a negative times a negative is a positive (I lost my grandmother a few weeks back and now my girl) and I know a positive blessing is around the corner. I’m saying this here because on Tuesday and Wednesday I had heavy urges to release but my mind has been built greatly and is wise to know MO will only make it worse, don’t give in to your demons. For anyone out there who is going through something similar or bad in general I just want you to know you’re not alone and to keep your head up, and don’t touch at all, you’ll thank yourself for it. Your mind is powerful as well as your speech so always tell yourself you’re full of positivity and are vibrant. In times of need just ask the Lord for strength, wisdom, and protection and to cast all dangers, evil, and negativity away from you. (if you’re religious). I’m still hurt from it but I’ve been working on my self and my craft even more and will let my success be the best revenge, as I forgive her and she revealed her true self to me, so I know to stray away from her and others like her. “Only a fool trips on something behind him.” Keep your heads up guys, you’ve got this! 💯

Update: I reached out to her and we spoke, I wish it had gone like I thought but on the bright side I got the closer I needed, I had my flaws and she had hers I was just to blind to see I needed to fix them fast, it was meant to happen though so I’ll keep my chin up and keep moving forward.",1584158837,315ru,Semenretention,i was ghosted    and im thankful,"tl dr

We had to work paraphrasing a poem in our own words for our English II class and our professor told us to look up other ones online just to get an idea of how to do it but do not copy anyone else’s work. He was clear on that. So, I came across one on Enotes.com of the poem I was working on. I read it and kept it moving. I did my own paraphrase in my own words, however this is an open discussion so as I’m reading other students submissions, I see that another students paraphrase sounded oddly familiar. Like exact. 

So I checked hers against the one on Enotes and it’s an exact copy!! It’s not really my business, but it pisses me off that everyone else took the time to actually paraphrase their selected poem and this girl copied someone else’s WORD FOR WORD!! It’s work done by a male teacher, it even has the teachers name on Enotes, so it’s for sure NOT her work!!

It can’t be a coincidence that hers is an exact copy of the one on Enotes. She didn’t even try to make it her own. 

Do I just keep it to myself or am I obligated to let my professor know? I feel so conflicted and really wanted others opinions if they were in this situation. TIA

176,2043948,fh1wd2,Summons and Damage Resistance,"Hello all,

I am new to Pathfinder and made an Arcanist Occultist who specializes in summons. I am really finding it hard to make use of summons since we are fighting a lot of undead/robots so far. I just got to level 3 so my summoning options are opening up.

Is there a way to get around damage resistance with summons? or at level 3 if I am not mistaken the best thing would be a fire elemental against robots but it seems very underwhelming.

I am pretty sure we will be fighting lots of robots and can't summon the ""non standard"" elementals. I am a little worried my summons will be kind of useless against most things we fight.

Looking at my choices I don't see much that is good against robots/undead. Maybe down the line I will get more, so far I have mainly just used my summons as decoys and to give flanking. I might just be oblivious I can't seem to find ways to make summonings more useful.

99,2454349,fa2qdw,An unflattering tale of a drunken guest.,"It always seems like drunk guests reveal their most unflattering sides of themselves, so here is a story of such an interaction. I've worked in hotels at the front desk for over 3 years so I have my fair share.

The first hotel I worked at was on a college campus, so we were commonly booked out with guests arriving to watch football games. Of course, these guests are never just here to watch a football game, they're also here to tailgate and go to bars. Some people would start tailgating as early as 7 in the morning, so they were constantly drinking all day. It doesn't help that in our city there was many bars directly on campus, which were about a 5 minute walk from a hotel. So many guests checked in already hammered on football nights.

A lady and what I assumed to be her husband come to check in at night. I assume the lady is in her late 30s or early 40s, I guess I could have known from checking her ID but I don't normally pay attention to the age when I'm checking guest's IDs. So I'm checking her in, and she proceeds to tell me that I look handsome and so I blush then say thank you. Then she proceeds to tell me that ""I can sleep in her bed tonight"" after which I blush even harder and awkwardly and uncomfortably laugh. Mind you, this was with what I assume to be her husband standing right next to her. THEN she proceeds to ask me if I'm specifically *17 years old,* to which I respond ""No, I'm 23 years old"" and I proceed to be totally creeped out and confused. Then the guest left me alone after that and I didn't hear back from her.",1582760575,2wlcx,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,an unflattering tale of a drunken guest ,"it always seems like drunk guests reveal their most unflattering sides of themselves so here is a story of such an interaction  ive worked in hotels at the front desk for over 3 years so i have my fair share

If you have tools and want to build a better world, I recommend making suns 400x smaller, planets 100x smaller, moon distances 1000x shorter, planet distances 10,000x shorter, and star distances 100,000x shorter. This way you can actually travel to planets in a solar system within reasonable times, while maintaining game engine limits with planetary sizes, and keep consistency with sizes and distances. The following chart is what I came up with after extrapolating data from NASA and the Hipparcos catalog. Note, only objects greater than 1000km were included. Sorry Charon.

528,2603198,e1o6ws,I have a great job that I don't believe I'm a good fit for,"Not sure if this is the right place to post, but you guys are a diverse group, so maybe you are best suited to help with career questions.

I am finishing school(biochemistry) in 2 weeks. I got a new job last May, and when I originally joined the team they were in dire need of a chemist, so I thought this was an excellent opportunity to get experience with a great team before I graduated. I'm 33, and am sort of trying to switch fields of science, going from hospital laboratory to(hopefully) research focused work. I didn't realize they wanted me to do the job as if I had had 20 years of experience as a chemist behind me. Since then I have been thrown into every type of assignment most of which I have had little idea about solutions and have had to start from scratch(ie look up academic papers to see how others are doing whatever needs to be done and copy them) devising solutions to all problems.

I am the only scientist on the team. I was given this position with the express intent to finish their patent(which I did), as well as head up their new laboratory division to figure out anything wrong in any of their product lines, and to have someone who might be able to set up a legitimate in-house lab. At the time, I was unsure whether I would be able to pull it off, but I knew I could set up high complexity analyzers at least, because I had just finished up a class teaching me exactly that. Now, however, I feel vastly unqualified and at this point I am constantly fearful that I will screw something up. Though I have set up a working HPLC analyzer which I am proud of, I am always questioning whether I am doing it right, and I have no one to check to ensure everything is done correctly and to an appropriate standard. Its not that I don't have experience as a scientist; I've worked in hospital labs for ~10 years, so I know my way around lab protocol, but this is R&D science, and for the most part my boss only cares about results. Some days I am successful, but many days I am not and I feel like an utter failure. Compound this with the last several months of me finishing up my degree, and I feel absolutely lost. I know this is likely the best job offer I've ever had(heading up a startup laboratory!), but the fact of the matter is that I do not feel qualified enough to be a one man science team. I say it all the time; science is a collaborative process! With no one to collaborate with, I have no one who will identify my mistakes and ensure that what I am doing is correct!

I feel bad about how I feel however. I have gained tons of skills at this job, and have learned critical thinking and self paced learning skills that I could never have learned on my own. I've gotten the opportunity to set up my very own HPLC analyzer and have gotten it up and running to give accurate results that I can be proud of(though no matter how many results I churn out, all I hear is ""more more more""). I finished a goddamn patent, which was exhausting, exhilarating, and maddening, but all in all a good experience to learn from. Despite these successes however, I feel like I need a mentor, someone with a masters or a phD, or at least a chance to work with a team of chemists or biochemists, so I can establish a more appropriate baseline of what its like to work in an actual chemistry lab, as opposed to hospital lab work or my own lab(where every SOP was written by me! Agh!).

I feel bad mostly because my work has paid for me to set up these analyzers, and they are counting on me to see them through on all of their research issues. I literally have all of their lab work within my desk and computer, and I have no idea how I could possibly tell them I don't want to work here anymore. I don't know if two weeks would be enough time for them to even find a replacement, or for me to transfer all of the vital knowledge I have in my head over to a new person. I feel wholly inadequate, and I guess I just don't know what to do. I'm scared, burnt out, and paralyzed by fear, mostly because I can't let everybody down. They are all counting on me. I'm kind of at the end of my rope. What do I do? I haven't even been here a year yet, so it probably won't even look good on a resume in the future, me quitting so soon. I would hope I could keep them as good references, but if I leave so early, I'm not sure if they would even give me good reference. Should I just keep going, despite my insecurities, so that I can gain experience to at some point join a larger team of chemists or biochemists? Or should I bail and look for a new job where I don't have to be in charge? I'm not even too sure what the job market looks like for new grad biochemists, since I've had a job my entire college experience, and haven't really been looking for a new one since I've been with this team.

Here are the rules!

In this thread, feel free to reply with something that you think will happen during the game. Try to avoid something that's obvious (""I bet Luka will score a point"", ""I think that Carlisle looks like Jim Carrey"") but rather things that you see happening but isn't guaranteed, (""Kleber blocks 2 different players,"" ""Someone hits a buzzer-beater at the end of a quarter"").

Sometime before the game, I'll collect the top comments as upvoted by you guys and make them into a bingo card. I think the free space will usually be ""Mavs get the W,"" although last year I did make exceptions during special occasions!

During the game, we'll watch and see if as a subreddit, we can hit Mavs Bingo for the night!

Could you guys submit each suggestion as its own individual comment, rather than grouping multiple into 1 comment? I'm trying to get a lot of users involved, and so I think it would be best if each suggestion was considered separately.

Note on Injured Players: For those people who want to make suggestions involving a player that might be out of the rotation, feel free to add a back-up suggestion in your comment that doesn't involve the player out of the rotation. That way I can use the backup if it's confirmed that your player is out.

If you're interested, please feel free to add your comments, and let's have some fun!",1582890390,2s53a,Mavericks,we celebrate lukas birthday in the rematch against the heat in miami as we play another round of mavs bingo  post your ideas here ,"welcome back everyone  time to play some mavs bingo vs the spurs tonight

787,1144421,f6a6xz,Improvements and technique ideas for Orihime,"What if Orihime will train even more and she becomes less timid, with a stronger resolve and killing intent? Here are just some ideas of possible new techniques and improvements. Sorry I suck in naming techniques and skills. I just can't.

1. Ultra-High speed Tsubaki: Tsubaki looks like a ninja. I think it is reasonable that he is much quicker than the other spirits/fairies. Koten Zanshun actually is deadly since it does not “cut” but repels both sides of the shield. So in theory, it should be able to cut through anything. I see it like Yondu's arrow (MCU) in the sense that it can cleanly pierce through anything and is very quick. If Orihime drastically trains Tsubaki's speed, then she has a weapon that is as lethal as lille's rifle, if not more lethal since Koten Zanshun can home in on a target.

2. Tsubaki clones/after images: Again, since he looks like a ninja, I will use that as inspiration for other techniques. Tsubaki creates after images or clones that can confuse opponents or make him appear that he attacks from multiple directions at the same time. Orihime can be more creative with this and use it like a weaker Senbonzakura (Gokei). It will prevent Tsubaki from being injured often.

3. Charged Koten Zanshun: much like a Getsuga Tenshou. Just a stronger and bigger Koten Zanshun attack.

4. Rejecting Barrier: Orihime creates a dome but instead of deflecting attacks, it rejects anything that comes in contact with the barrier either from the inside or from outside. Only the other spirits can come in and out of the barrier without being harmed. Orihime was somehow able to do something like this while healing Ichigo before he would fight grimmjow.

5. Binding barrier: Another way to use the Santen Kesshun is to immobilize the target like bakudo 61 that Byakuya uses. Orihime uses 3 spirits to suround the target and creates a shield while target is in the middle. While bound, She can use Koten Zanshun to barrage the enemy.",1582115853,2rk7q,bleach,improvements and technique ideas for orihime,"what if orihime will train even more and she becomes less timid with a stronger resolve and killing intent  here are just some ideas of possible new techniques and improvements  sorry i suck in naming techniques and skills  i just cant

There are hundreds of complaints about false positives at GMail. There's a long thread at [Ycombinator](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19756125) . One small extract:

>I appreciate the  response. From someone who has operated a mail server since 2002, it  comes across that Gmail does not care about cooperating with small but  legitimate mail servers.  
>  
>SPF, DKIM, reverse DNS, no blacklists, no open relay, longtime ownership  of IPs, etc etc. Using various mail testers returns a 10/10  deliverability score.  
>  
>And yet, messages sent to Gmail always go into the spam folder, or are  never delivered at all. These are everyday regular messages, I have  never used mailing lists or sent bulk automated messages.  
>  
>The issue is, there is no recourse, no fix, no acknowledgement of the  problem with false positives. There is no tool available to me to  understand or correct the ""problem"". Hint: this comes across as Gmail  not giving a shit.

297,1939407,f6t1br,No one believes me when I tell them what happened,"I took my fiancé to a urgent care and I left my purse there. So I went back to get it and it was about 30 mins before they closed and I noticed when I pulled in there was a bunch more cars there compared to when I was there earlier. I walked in and the waiting room was packed and there was someone sitting in the seats where I was sitting filling out papers and I was trying to look under the chair without trying to make it seem I was looking at them. I went to the window and asked if a purse was found and she gave it to me. I was in there for about 60 seconds and once I turned around the waiting room was empty. Once I turned around I was literally like 😱🤯wtf!?!? There was only two doors in the room and the one to go back to the doctor is right by the window so within my view and I saw no one go back. The other door is the exit and I feel like I would’ve heard a whole waiting room full of people shuffle towards the door and I was only turned around for all of 45 seconds and plus there where people filling out papers and sitting in the back in the corner so it just really messed me up because I feel like by the time I turned around it wouldn’t have even gave half of them enough time to leave. This was two days ago. This next thing might not be as major and maybe has a reasonable explanation but my roommate asked me to move my car and when I turned the car on I cut the lights off cause it was shining in their face. Once they pulled out and I got back into the drive way I literally told myself to turn the lights back on or I would end up driving around without them on and I turned the nob and took the key out. Later that night me and my fiancé went to Cracker Barrel and the whole ride I’m like I can’t see the road and I’m like why!?! And I knew my lights where on so I was just pissed. We get all the way back home and we get on our road where there are no street lights and I’m like hold up my lights aren’t on when I know for a fact I cut them on. Which idk maybe a reasonable explanation for that but it just threw me off and if the thing with the waiting room hadn’t just happened in the same day I would’ve probably thought nothing of it. The next day I used my dads debit card to go get food for him and accidentally forgot to give it back to him. Later that day he calls and asks me to bring it but get some money out the atm. So I went and got the money and headed to his house but then I saw his girlfriend driving up their road and I waved at her and thought why didn’t he just wait and send her to get the money? But anyways then I pull into the drive way and her car is there so I was like what i literally just drove by you. I go inside and she’s in there. I told her what just happened and she was like well there are a lot of Honda’s around and I was like yeah but right up the road from your house with you inside of them?? And again maybe there’s a logical explanation for that but idk she has a brand new 2020 Honda so I want to know the likeliness that there would be one on the exact same road with someone who looked just like her! And waved at me like she knew me. I’ve just been feeling weird the past few days since the waiting room thing. Last night I went to dollar tree and pulled into a spot next to a big SUV and noticed a big sticker on the back of their car and then went inside. When I came back out my car was two spots away from the SUV. Idk y’all I’m not crazy but it’s been 3 days and if anything weird happens today I’m gonna freak out.

These next incidents im about to add happened between a month to three years ago I don’t know if they technically fit but they were weird instances so I wanted to add them. 

About a month ago I was watching my niece at my sisters house and she has two dogs and she was sleeping and they wouldn’t be quiet so I went into the kitchen and literally A split second before “shut up dogs” came out of my mouth I heard a very loud stern manly voice yell “HUSH” it sounded like it came from right beside me but like over me like a tall man would’ve said it. The dogs heard it too I was so shook i literally locked myself in the living room for the rest of the time I was there. I even had to check the attic to make sure no one was here. She just moved into this house the first week of January so I’m not sure if anything like that has happened before but I didn’t want to tell my sister because she was already scared of this house because she thought she heard somebody breaking in but it ended up being nothing. 

About two or three years ago my fiancé and I was staying at my dads my fiancé went to go see his grandmother in the hospital and I stayed home. I’m just gonna add my door frame was messed up so it didn’t really close right, it didn’t click into the hole so you could pull/push the door while it was locked. Anyways I’m just chilling and I hear something in the hall way sounded like foot steps but like they stoped right in front of my door and our dog heard it too he went up to the door and started sniffing. The only people home are me my dad and his girlfriend and they work 3rd shift so I know they where asleep. I tried to ignore it and turn on my TV but then something snatched my door handle so hard it made me and my dog jump and I never went to check it out but I know it wasn’t my dad because I heard him come out of his room later on so idk. 


I would say this was about 3-4 years ago me my fiancé and his mom went to get my sister in law from the beach. We went to the sand and stayed on the beach for about 30 minutes or so and we saw this huuuuge ship like gigantic you could see it from a mile away. Anyways we’re all like damnnn that thing huge. Then we start talking about this light house over to the left right off the island and there’s no way we where turned around for more than a minute or two and we turn back around and this ship is gone!
